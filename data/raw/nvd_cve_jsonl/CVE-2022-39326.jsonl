{"id":"CVE-2022-39326","publishedDate":"2022-10-25T17:15:56.087","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"kartverket/github-workflows are shared reusable workflows for GitHub Actions. Prior to version 2.7.5, all users of the `run-terraform` reusable workflow from the kartverket/github-workflows repo are affected by a code injection vulnerability. A malicious actor could potentially send a PR with a malicious payload leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the workflow. Users should upgrade to at least version 2.7.5 to resolve the issue. As a workaround, review any pull requests from external users for malicious payloads before allowing them to trigger a build.","references":["https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/pull/19","https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/releases/tag/v2.7.5","https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-f9qj-7gh3-mhj4","https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/pull/19","https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/releases/tag/v2.7.5","https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-f9qj-7gh3-mhj4"]}
