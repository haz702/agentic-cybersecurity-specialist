{"id":"CVE-2023-39198","publishedDate":"2023-11-09T20:15:08.730","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A race condition was found in the QXL driver in the Linux kernel. The qxl_mode_dumb_create() function dereferences the qobj returned by the qxl_gem_object_create_with_handle(), but the handle is the only one holding a reference to it. This flaw allows an attacker to guess the returned handle value and trigger a use-after-free issue, potentially leading to a denial of service or privilege escalation.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2394","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2950","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3138","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39198","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2218332","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2394","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2950","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3138","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39198","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2218332","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00016.html"]}
