{"id":"CVE-2023-32559","publishedDate":"2023-08-24T02:15:09.210","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the experimental policy mechanism in all active release lines: 16.x, 18.x and, 20.x. The use of the deprecated API `process.binding()` can bypass the policy mechanism by requiring internal modules and eventually take advantage of `process.binding('spawn_sync')` run arbitrary code, outside of the limits defined in a `policy.json` file. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued, the policy is an experimental feature of Node.js.","references":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1946470","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0006/","https://hackerone.com/reports/1946470","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0006/"]}
