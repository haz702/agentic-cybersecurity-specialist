{"id":"CVE-2023-22495","publishedDate":"2023-01-14T01:15:15.300","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Izanami is a shared configuration service well-suited for micro-service architecture implementation. Attackers can bypass the authentication in this application when deployed using the official Docker image.
