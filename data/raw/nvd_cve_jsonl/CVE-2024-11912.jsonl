This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.","references":["https://travelerwp.com/traveler-changelog/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/febd1ff3-3a1a-49c2-b210-9e72051e3172?source=cve"]}
