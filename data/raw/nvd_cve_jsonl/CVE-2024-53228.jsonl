This is used as a special marker for the base\nextensions, that cannot be disabled. However, when traversing the\nextensions, that special marker is not checked prior indexing the\narray.\n\nAdd an out-of-bounds check to the function.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/332fa4a802b16ccb727199da685294f85f9880cb","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3c49e1084a5df99807fc43dd318c491e6cbaa168","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b1af648f0d610665c956ea4604d9f797e5c7e991"]}
