{"id":"CVE-2023-1326","publishedDate":"2023-04-13T23:15:07.180","cvssV3":7.7,"description":"A privilege escalation attack was found in apport-cli 2.26.0 and earlier which is similar to CVE-2023-26604. If a system is specially configured to allow unprivileged users to run sudo apport-cli, less is configured as the pager, and the terminal size can be set: a local attacker can escalate privilege. It is extremely unlikely that a system administrator would configure sudo to allow unprivileged users to perform this class of exploit.","references":["https://github.com/canonical/apport/commit/e5f78cc89f1f5888b6a56b785dddcb0364c48ecb","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6018-1","https://github.com/canonical/apport/commit/e5f78cc89f1f5888b6a56b785dddcb0364c48ecb","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6018-1"]}
