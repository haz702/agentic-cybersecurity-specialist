{"id":"CVE-2024-21575","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T15:15:12.733","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"ComfyUI-Impact-Pack is vulnerable to Path Traversal. The issue stems from missing validation of the `image.filename` field in a POST request sent to the `/upload/temp` endpoint added by the extension to the server. This results in writing arbitrary files to the file system which may, under some conditions, result in remote code execution (RCE).","references":["https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack/blob/1087f2ee063c9d53cd198add79b41a7a3465c05a/modules/impact/impact_server.py#L28","https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack/commit/a43dae373e648ae0f0cc0c9768c3cea6a72acff7"]}
