{"id":"CVE-2023-42447","publishedDate":"2023-09-19T15:15:57.270","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"blurhash-rs is a pure Rust implementation of Blurhash, software for encoding images into ASCII strings that can be turned into a gradient of colors representing the original image. In version 0.1.1, the blurhash parsing code may panic due to multiple panic-guarded out-of-bounds accesses on untrusted input. In a typical deployment, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted blurhashes over the network. These may include UTF-8 compliant strings containing multi-byte UTF-8 characters. A patch is available in version 0.2.0, which requires user intervention because of slight API churn. No known workarounds are available.","references":["https://github.com/whisperfish/blurhash-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-cxvp-82cq-57h2","https://github.com/whisperfish/blurhash-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-cxvp-82cq-57h2"]}
