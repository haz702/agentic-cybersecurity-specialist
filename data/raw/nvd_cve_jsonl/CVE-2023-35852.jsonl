{"id":"CVE-2023-35852","publishedDate":"2023-06-19T04:15:11.217","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In Suricata before 6.0.13 (when there is an adversary who controls an external source of rules), a dataset filename, that comes from a rule, may trigger absolute or relative directory traversal, and lead to write access to a local filesystem. This is addressed in 6.0.13 by requiring allow-absolute-filenames and allow-write (in the datasets rules configuration section) if an installation requires traversal/writing in this situation.","references":["https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/735f5aa9ca3b28cfacc7a443f93a44387fbacf17","https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/aee1523b4591430ebed1ded0bb95508e6717a335","https://github.com/OISF/suricata/compare/suricata-6.0.12...suricata-6.0.13","https://www.stamus-networks.com/stamus-labs","https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/735f5aa9ca3b28cfacc7a443f93a44387fbacf17","https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/aee1523b4591430ebed1ded0bb95508e6717a335","https://github.com/OISF/suricata/compare/suricata-6.0.12...suricata-6.0.13","https://www.stamus-networks.com/stamus-labs"]}
