Hotdog, prior to v1.0.2, did not mimic the resource limits, device restrictions, or syscall filters of the target JVM process. This would allow a container to exhaust the resources of the host, modify devices, or make syscalls that would otherwise be blocked.","references":["https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/hotdog/security/advisories/GHSA-jr96-7frv-3mpj","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/aws-log4shell-hot-patch-vulnerabilities","https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/hotdog/security/advisories/GHSA-jr96-7frv-3mpj","https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/aws-log4shell-hot-patch-vulnerabilities"]}
