This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-blip.c by allowing reasonable compression ratios and rejecting ZIP bombs.","references":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00035.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00038.html","https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/commit/4a948427100b6c109f4ec7b4361f0d2aec5e5c3f","https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/16866","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DQHPKZFQ7W3X34RYN3FWFYCFJD4FXJW/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6IGRYKW4XLR44YDWTAH547ODYYBYPB2D/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZUHMK5HYTUUDXA64T2TAMAFMYV674QBW/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2020-13.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00035.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00038.html","https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/commit/4a948427100b6c109f4ec7b4361f0d2aec5e5c3f","https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/16866","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DQHPKZFQ7W3X34RYN3FWFYCFJD4FXJW/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6IGRYKW4XLR44YDWTAH547ODYYBYPB2D/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZUHMK5HYTUUDXA64T2TAMAFMYV674QBW/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2020-13.html"]}
