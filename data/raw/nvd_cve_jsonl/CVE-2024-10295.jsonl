{"id":"CVE-2024-10295","publishedDate":"2024-10-24T18:15:05.597","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A flaw was found in Gateway. Sending a non-base64 'basic' auth with special characters can cause APICast to incorrectly authenticate a request. A malformed basic authentication header containing special characters bypasses authentication and allows unauthorized access to the backend. This issue can occur due to a failure in the base64 decoding process, which causes APICast to skip the rest of the authentication checks and proceed with routing the request upstream.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-10295","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2321258"]}
