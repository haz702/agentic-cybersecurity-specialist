{"id":"CVE-2024-52799","publishedDate":"2024-11-21T17:15:24.220","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"Argo Workflows Chart is used to set up argo and its needed dependencies through one command. Prior to 0.44.0, the workflow-role has excessive privileges, the worst being create pods/exec, which will allow kubectl exec into any Pod in the same namespace, i.e. arbitrary code execution within those Pods. If a user can be made to run a malicious template, their whole namespace can be compromised. This affects versions of the argo-workflows Chart that use appVersion: 3.4 and above, which no longer need these permissions for the only available Executor, Emissary. It could also affect users below 3.4 depending on their choice of Executor in those versions. This only affects the Helm Chart and not the upstream manifests. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.44.0.","references":["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/commit/81dc44c4a5ccd42c799469a78eb96a68048a4987","https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/security/advisories/GHSA-fgrf-2886-4q7m"]}
