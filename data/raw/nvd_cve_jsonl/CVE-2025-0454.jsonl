{"id":"CVE-2025-0454","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:53.157","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in the Requests utility of significant-gravitas/autogpt versions prior to v0.4.0. The vulnerability arises due to a hostname confusion between the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` library and the `requests` library. A malicious user can exploit this by submitting a specially crafted URL, such as `http://localhost:\\@google.com/../`, to bypass the SSRF check and perform an SSRF attack.","references":["https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/commit/ff065cd24c2289878c0abdb9adbf91c305f0d70a","https://huntr.com/bounties/0664fdee-bdc2-4650-8075-74d7b8d3e308"]}
