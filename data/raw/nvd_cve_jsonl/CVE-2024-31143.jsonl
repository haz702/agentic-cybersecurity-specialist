Unlike for MSI-X,\nthe setting up of these consecutive vectors needs to happen all in one\ngo.  In this handling an error path could be taken in different\nsituations, with or without a particular lock held.  This error path\nwrongly releases the lock even when it is not currently held.\n","references":["https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-458.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/16/3","http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-458.html","https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-458.html"]}
