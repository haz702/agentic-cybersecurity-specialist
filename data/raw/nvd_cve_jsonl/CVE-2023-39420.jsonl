{"id":"CVE-2023-39420","publishedDate":"2023-09-07T13:15:08.517","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"The RDPCore.dll component as used in the IRM Next Generation booking engine, allows a remote user to connect to customers with an \"admin\" account and a corresponding password computed daily by a routine inside the DLL file. Once reverse-engineered, this routine can help an attacker generate the daily password and connect to application customers. Given that this is an administrative account, anyone logging into a customer deployment has full, unrestricted access to the application.","references":["https://bitdefender.com/blog/labs/check-out-with-extra-charges-vulnerabilities-in-hotel-booking-engine-explained/","https://bitdefender.com/blog/labs/check-out-with-extra-charges-vulnerabilities-in-hotel-booking-engine-explained/"]}
