{"id":"CVE-2023-4918","publishedDate":"2023-09-12T20:15:10.390","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A flaw was found in the Keycloak package, more specifically org.keycloak.userprofile. When a user registers itself through registration flow, the \"password\" and \"password-confirm\" field from the form will occur as regular user attributes. All users and clients with proper rights and roles are able to read users attributes, allowing a malicious user with minimal access to retrieve the users passwords in clear text, jeopardizing their environment.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4918","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2238588","https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-5q66-v53q-pm35","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4918","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2238588","https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/advisories/GHSA-5q66-v53q-pm35"]}
