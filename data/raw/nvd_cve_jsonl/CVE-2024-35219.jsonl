{"id":"CVE-2024-35219","publishedDate":"2024-05-27T16:15:09.027","cvssV3":8.3,"description":"OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. Prior to version 7.6.0, attackers can exploit a path traversal vulnerability to read and delete files and folders from an arbitrary, writable directory as anyone can set the output folder when submitting the request via the `outputFolder` option. The issue was fixed in version 7.6.0 by removing the usage of the `outputFolder` option. No known workarounds are available.","references":["https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/edbb021aadae47dcfe690313ce5119faf77f800d","https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/18652","https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/security/advisories/GHSA-g3hr-p86p-593h","https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/commit/edbb021aadae47dcfe690313ce5119faf77f800d","https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/18652","https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/security/advisories/GHSA-g3hr-p86p-593h"]}
