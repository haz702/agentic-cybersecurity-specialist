{"id":"CVE-2022-23594","publishedDate":"2022-02-04T23:15:15.410","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The TFG dialect of TensorFlow (MLIR) makes several assumptions about the incoming `GraphDef` before converting it to the MLIR-based dialect. If an attacker changes the `SavedModel` format on disk to invalidate these assumptions and the `GraphDef` is then converted to MLIR-based IR then they can cause a crash in the Python interpreter. Under certain scenarios, heap OOB read/writes are possible. These issues have been discovered via fuzzing and it is possible that more weaknesses exist. We will patch them as they are discovered.","references":["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-9x52-887g-fhc2","https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244/tensorflow/core/ir/importexport","https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-9x52-887g-fhc2","https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244/tensorflow/core/ir/importexport"]}
