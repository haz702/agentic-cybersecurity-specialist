{"id":"CVE-2022-41973","publishedDate":"2022-10-29T18:15:12.993","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"multipath-tools 0.7.7 through 0.9.x before 0.9.2 allows local users to obtain root access, as exploited in conjunction with CVE-2022-41974. Local users able to access /dev/shm can change symlinks in multipathd due to incorrect symlink handling, which could lead to controlled file writes outside of the /dev/shm directory. This could be used indirectly for local privilege escalation to root.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/169611/Leeloo-Multipath-Authorization-Bypass-Symlink-Attack.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170176/snap-confine-must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms-Race-Condition.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Dec/4","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/25","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/24/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/30/2","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1202739","https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools/releases/tag/0.9.2","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00037.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QIGZM5NOOMFDCITOLQEJNNX5SCRQLQVV/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-06","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5366","https://www.qualys.com/2022/10/24/leeloo-multipath/leeloo-multipath.txt","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/169611/Leeloo-Multipath-Authorization-Bypass-Symlink-Attack.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170176/snap-confine-must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms-Race-Condition.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Dec/4","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/25","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/24/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/30/2","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1202739","https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools/releases/tag/0.9.2","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00037.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QIGZM5NOOMFDCITOLQEJNNX5SCRQLQVV/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-06","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5366","https://www.qualys.com/2022/10/24/leeloo-multipath/leeloo-multipath.txt"]}
