{"id":"CVE-2024-8060","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:40.373","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"OpenWebUI version 0.3.0 contains a vulnerability in the audio API endpoint `/audio/api/v1/transcriptions` that allows for arbitrary file upload. The application performs insufficient validation on the `file.content_type` and allows user-controlled filenames, leading to a path traversal vulnerability. This can be exploited by an authenticated user to overwrite critical files within the Docker container, potentially leading to remote code execution as the root user.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/a3b1a4b7-c723-496d-842c-844cc0988fe9"]}
