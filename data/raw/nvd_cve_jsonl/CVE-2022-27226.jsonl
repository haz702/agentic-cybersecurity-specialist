{"id":"CVE-2022-27226","publishedDate":"2022-03-19T04:15:08.793","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A CSRF issue in /api/crontab on iRZ Mobile Routers through 2022-03-16 allows a threat actor to create a crontab entry in the router administration panel. The cronjob will consequently execute the entry on the threat actor's defined interval, leading to remote code execution, allowing the threat actor to gain filesystem access. In addition, if the router's default credentials aren't rotated or a threat actor discovers valid credentials, remote code execution can be achieved without user interaction.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166396/iRZ-Mobile-Router-Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-Remote-Code-Execution.html","https://en.irz.ru","https://github.com/SakuraSamuraii/ez-iRZ","https://johnjhacking.com/blog/cve-2022-27226/","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166396/iRZ-Mobile-Router-Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-Remote-Code-Execution.html","https://en.irz.ru","https://github.com/SakuraSamuraii/ez-iRZ","https://johnjhacking.com/blog/cve-2022-27226/"]}
