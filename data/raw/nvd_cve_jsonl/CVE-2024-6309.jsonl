{"id":"CVE-2024-6309","publishedDate":"2024-07-09T08:15:11.550","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Attachment File Icons (AF Icons) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 1.3. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'afi_overview' function and missing file type validation in the 'upload_icons' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/attachment-file-icons/tags/1.3/attachment-file-icons.php#L130","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/attachment-file-icons/tags/1.3/attachment-file-icons.php#L337","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7e3fd472-c8ea-42dc-93df-872361ec97f3?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/attachment-file-icons/tags/1.3/attachment-file-icons.php#L130","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/attachment-file-icons/tags/1.3/attachment-file-icons.php#L337","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7e3fd472-c8ea-42dc-93df-872361ec97f3?source=cve"]}
