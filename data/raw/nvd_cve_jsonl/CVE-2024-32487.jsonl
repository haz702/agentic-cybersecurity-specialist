{"id":"CVE-2024-32487","publishedDate":"2024-04-13T15:15:52.683","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"less through 653 allows OS command execution via a newline character in the name of a file, because quoting is mishandled in filename.c. Exploitation typically requires use with attacker-controlled file names, such as the files extracted from an untrusted archive. Exploitation also requires the LESSOPEN environment variable, but this is set by default in many common cases.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/1","https://github.com/gwsw/less/commit/007521ac3c95bc76e3d59c6dbfe75d06c8075c33","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00018.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240605-0009/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/5","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/13/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/1","https://github.com/gwsw/less/commit/007521ac3c95bc76e3d59c6dbfe75d06c8075c33","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00018.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240605-0009/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/5","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/13/2"]}
