{"id":"CVE-2021-3907","publishedDate":"2021-11-11T22:15:07.820","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"OctoRPKI does not escape a URI with a filename containing \"..\", this allows a repository to create a file, (ex. rsync://example.org/repo/../../etc/cron.daily/evil.roa), which would then be written to disk outside the base cache folder. This could allow for remote code execution on the host machine OctoRPKI is running on.","references":["https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/security/advisories/GHSA-3jhm-87m6-x959","https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/security/advisories/GHSA-cqh2-vc2f-q4fh","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5033","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5041","https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/security/advisories/GHSA-3jhm-87m6-x959","https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/security/advisories/GHSA-cqh2-vc2f-q4fh","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5033","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5041"]}
