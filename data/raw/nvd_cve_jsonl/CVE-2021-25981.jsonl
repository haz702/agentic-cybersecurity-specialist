This may allow an attacker to reuse the admin\u2019s still-valid session token even when logged-out, to gain admin privileges, given the attacker is able to obtain that token (via other, hypothetical attacks)","references":["https://github.com/debiki/talkyard/commit/b0310df019887f3464895529c773bc7d85ddcf34","https://github.com/debiki/talkyard/commit/b0712915d8a22a20b09a129924e8a29c25ae5761","https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2021-25981","https://github.com/debiki/talkyard/commit/b0310df019887f3464895529c773bc7d85ddcf34","https://github.com/debiki/talkyard/commit/b0712915d8a22a20b09a129924e8a29c25ae5761","https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2021-25981"]}
