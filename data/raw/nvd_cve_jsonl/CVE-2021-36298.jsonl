{"id":"CVE-2021-36298","publishedDate":"2021-10-01T21:15:08.180","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"Dell EMC InsightIQ, versions prior to 4.1.4, contain risky cryptographic algorithms in the SSH component. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability leading to authentication bypass and remote takeover of the InsightIQ. This allows an attacker to take complete control of InsightIQ to affect services provided by SSH; so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.","references":["https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/000191604","https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/000191604"]}
