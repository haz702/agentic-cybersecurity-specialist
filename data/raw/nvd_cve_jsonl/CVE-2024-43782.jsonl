{"id":"CVE-2024-43782","publishedDate":"2024-08-23T15:15:16.600","cvssV3":7.7,"description":"This openedx-translations repository contains translation files from Open edX repositories to be kept in sync with Transifex. Before moving to pulling translations from the openedx-translations repository via openedx-atlas, translations in the edx-platform repository were validated using edx-i18n-tools. This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based script injections. Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the openedx-translations repository did not include the same protections. The maintainer inspected the translations in the edx-platform directory of both the main and open-release/redwood.master branches of the openedx-translations repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings.","references":["https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/3c4093705dec99590577c4d8270ce263f7fffc5a","https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/b2444340e8702c7955310331c1db5fd85b25b92b","https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/security/advisories/GHSA-fg8c-2pvj-wx3j"]}
