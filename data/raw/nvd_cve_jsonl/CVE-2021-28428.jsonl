The original file upload vulnerability (CVE-2020-27387) was remediated by restricting the PHP extensions; however, we confirmed that the filter was bypassed via uploading an arbitrary .htaccess and *.hello files in order to execute PHP code to gain RCE.","references":["https://github.com/ttimot24/HorizontCMS","https://github.com/ttimot24/HorizontCMS/commit/9c4d6827cbe96decec6834d53660e14ab2bf8838","https://github.com/ttimot24/HorizontCMS","https://github.com/ttimot24/HorizontCMS/commit/9c4d6827cbe96decec6834d53660e14ab2bf8838"]}
