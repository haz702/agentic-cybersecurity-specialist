{"id":"CVE-2024-57995","publishedDate":"2025-02-27T02:15:13.517","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: fix read pointer after free in ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev()\n\nIn ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev(), if arvif is created on a different\nradio, it gets deleted from that radio through a call to\nath12k_mac_unassign_link_vif(). This action frees the arvif pointer.\nSubsequently, there is a check involving arvif, which will result in a\nread-after-free scenario.\n\nFix this by moving this check after arvif is again assigned via call to\nath12k_mac_assign_link_vif().\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5a10971c7645a95f5d5dc23c26fbac4bf61801d0","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f3a95a312419e4f1e992525917da9dbcd247038f"]}
