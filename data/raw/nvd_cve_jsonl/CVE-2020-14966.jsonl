{"id":"CVE-2020-14966","publishedDate":"2020-06-22T12:15:10.087","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An issue was discovered in the jsrsasign package through 8.0.18 for Node.js. It allows a malleability in ECDSA signatures by not checking overflows in the length of a sequence and '0' characters appended or prepended to an integer. The modified signatures are verified as valid. This could have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single canonical signature.","references":["https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/437","https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.17","https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.18","https://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200724-0001/","https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsrsasign","https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/437","https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.17","https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.18","https://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200724-0001/","https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsrsasign"]}
