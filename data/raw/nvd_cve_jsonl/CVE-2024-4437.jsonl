{"id":"CVE-2024-4437","publishedDate":"2024-05-08T09:15:09.467","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The etcd package distributed with the Red Hat OpenStack platform has an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-44716. This issue occurs because the etcd package in the Red Hat OpenStack platform is using http://golang.org/x/net/http2 instead of the one provided by Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions, meaning it should be updated at compile time instead.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3352","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3467","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-4437","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2279361","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3352","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3467","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-4437","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2279361"]}
