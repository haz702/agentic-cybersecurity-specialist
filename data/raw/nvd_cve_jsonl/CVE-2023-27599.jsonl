{"id":"CVE-2023-27599","publishedDate":"2023-03-15T21:15:09.247","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, when the function `append_hf` handles a SIP message with a malformed To header, a call to the function `abort()` is performed, resulting in a crash. This is due to the following check in `data_lump.c:399` in the function `anchor_lump`. An attacker abusing this vulnerability will crash OpenSIPS leading to Denial of Service. It affects configurations containing functions that make use of the affected code, such as the function `append_hf`. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.","references":["https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/cb56694d290530ac308f44b453c18120b1c1109d","https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-qvj2-vqrg-f5jx","https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf","https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/cb56694d290530ac308f44b453c18120b1c1109d","https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-qvj2-vqrg-f5jx","https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf"]}
