By prematurely deleting objects associated with pages, a specially-crafted PDF document can trigger the reuse of previously freed memory, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file to trigger this vulnerability. Exploitation is also possible if a user visits a specially-crafted, malicious site if the browser plugin extension is enabled.","references":["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1600","https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1600"]}
