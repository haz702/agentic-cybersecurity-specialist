{"id":"CVE-2022-3747","publishedDate":"2022-11-29T21:15:11.143","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Becustom plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5.2. This is due to missing nonce validation when saving the plugin's settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugin's settings like betheme_url_slug, replaced_theme_author, and betheme_label to name a few, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://github.com/MrTuxracer/advisories/blob/master/CVEs/CVE-2022-3747.txt","https://muffingroup.com/betheme/features/be-custom/","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories-continued/#CVE-2022-3747","https://github.com/MrTuxracer/advisories/blob/master/CVEs/CVE-2022-3747.txt","https://muffingroup.com/betheme/features/be-custom/","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories-continued/#CVE-2022-3747"]}
