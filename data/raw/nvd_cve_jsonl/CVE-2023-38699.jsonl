{"id":"CVE-2023-38699","publishedDate":"2023-08-04T18:15:15.797","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"MindsDB's AI Virtual Database allows developers to connect any AI/ML model to any datasource. Prior to version 23.7.4.0, a call to requests with `verify=False` disables SSL certificate checks. This rule enforces always verifying SSL certificates for methods in the Requests library. In version 23.7.4.0, certificates are validated by default, which is the desired behavior.","references":["https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/commit/083afcf6567cf51aa7d89ea892fd97689919053b","https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/releases/tag/v23.7.4.0","https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/security/advisories/GHSA-8hx6-qv6f-xgcw","https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/commit/083afcf6567cf51aa7d89ea892fd97689919053b","https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/releases/tag/v23.7.4.0","https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/security/advisories/GHSA-8hx6-qv6f-xgcw"]}
