{"id":"CVE-2020-15170","publishedDate":"2020-09-10T19:15:13.583","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"apollo-adminservice before version 1.7.1 does not implement access controls. If users expose apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there are potential security issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet and it doesn't have access control built-in. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice apis directly to access/edit the application's configurations. To fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice to internet.","references":["https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/pull/3233/commits/ae9ba6cfd32ed80469f162e5e3583e2477862ddf","https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/security/advisories/GHSA-xpmx-h7xq-xffh","https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/pull/3233/commits/ae9ba6cfd32ed80469f162e5e3583e2477862ddf","https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/security/advisories/GHSA-xpmx-h7xq-xffh"]}
