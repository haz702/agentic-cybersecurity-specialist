This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create administrator accounts on the target website when the plugin is installed and activated but not configured with an API key.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/suretriggers/trunk/src/Controllers/RestController.php#L59","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3266499%40suretriggers%2Ftrunk&old=3264905%40suretriggers%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ec017311-f150-4a14-a4b4-b5634f574e2b?source=cve"]}
