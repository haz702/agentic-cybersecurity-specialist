{"id":"CVE-2023-4622","publishedDate":"2023-09-06T14:15:12.193","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's af_unix component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nThe unix_stream_sendpage() function tries to add data to the last skb in the peer's recv queue without locking the queue. Thus there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb locklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175963/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0099-1.html","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?h=linux-6.1.y&id=790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c","https://kernel.dance/790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00027.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5492","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175963/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0099-1.html","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?h=linux-6.1.y&id=790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c","https://kernel.dance/790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00027.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5492"]}
