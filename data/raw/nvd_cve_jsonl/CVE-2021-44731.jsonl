{"id":"CVE-2021-44731","publishedDate":"2022-02-17T23:15:07.473","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A race condition existed in the snapd 2.54.2 snap-confine binary when preparing a private mount namespace for a snap. This could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges by bind-mounting their own contents inside the snap's private mount namespace and causing snap-confine to execute arbitrary code and hence gain privilege escalation. Fixed in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04 and 2.54.3+21.10.1","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170176/snap-confine-must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms-Race-Condition.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Dec/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/18/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/23/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/23/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/30/2","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3QTBN7LLZISXIA4KU4UKDR27Q5PXDS2U/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XCGHG6LJAVJJ72TMART6A7N4Z6MSTGI7/","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5292-1","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5080","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170176/snap-confine-must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms-Race-Condition.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Dec/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/18/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/23/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/23/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/30/2","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3QTBN7LLZISXIA4KU4UKDR27Q5PXDS2U/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XCGHG6LJAVJJ72TMART6A7N4Z6MSTGI7/","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5292-1","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5080"]}
