{"id":"CVE-2021-21385","publishedDate":"2021-03-24T21:15:15.070","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Mifos-Mobile Android Application for MifosX is an Android Application built on top of the MifosX Self-Service platform. Mifos-Mobile before commit e505f62 disables HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP client. Additionally it accepted any self-signed certificate as valid. Hostname verification is an important part when using HTTPS to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks. Accepting any certificate, even self-signed ones allows man-in-the-middle attacks. This problem is fixed in mifos-mobile commit e505f62.","references":["https://github.com/openMF/mifos-mobile/commit/e505f62b92b19292bfdabd6e996ab76abfeaa90d","https://github.com/openMF/mifos-mobile/security/advisories/GHSA-9657-33wf-rmvx","https://openmf.github.io/mobileapps.github.io/","https://github.com/openMF/mifos-mobile/commit/e505f62b92b19292bfdabd6e996ab76abfeaa90d","https://github.com/openMF/mifos-mobile/security/advisories/GHSA-9657-33wf-rmvx","https://openmf.github.io/mobileapps.github.io/"]}
