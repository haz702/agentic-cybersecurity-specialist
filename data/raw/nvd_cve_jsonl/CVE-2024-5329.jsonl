{"id":"CVE-2024-5329","publishedDate":"2024-06-06T10:15:10.493","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection via the \u2018data[addonID]\u2019 parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.109 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/inc_php/unitecreator_addons.class.php#L999","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3097249/#file6","https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f33d77b7-5412-47bf-9bed-8617151723c9?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/inc_php/unitecreator_addons.class.php#L999","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3097249/#file6","https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f33d77b7-5412-47bf-9bed-8617151723c9?source=cve"]}
