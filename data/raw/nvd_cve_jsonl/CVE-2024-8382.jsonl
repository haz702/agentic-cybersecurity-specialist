This vulnerability affects Firefox < 130, Firefox ESR < 128.2, Firefox ESR < 115.15, Thunderbird < 128.2, and Thunderbird < 115.15.","references":["https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1906744","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-39/","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-40/","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-41/","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-43/","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-44/"]}
