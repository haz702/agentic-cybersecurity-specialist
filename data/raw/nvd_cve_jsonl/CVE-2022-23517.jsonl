{"id":"CVE-2022-23517","publishedDate":"2022-12-14T17:15:10.130","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"rails-html-sanitizer is responsible for sanitizing HTML fragments in Rails applications. Certain configurations of rails-html-sanitizer < 1.4.4 use an inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.4.","references":["https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/commit/56c61c0cebd1e493e8ad7bca2a0191609a4a6979","https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-5x79-w82f-gw8w","https://hackerone.com/reports/1684163","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00012.html","https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/commit/56c61c0cebd1e493e8ad7bca2a0191609a4a6979","https://github.com/rails/rails-html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-5x79-w82f-gw8w","https://hackerone.com/reports/1684163","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00012.html"]}
