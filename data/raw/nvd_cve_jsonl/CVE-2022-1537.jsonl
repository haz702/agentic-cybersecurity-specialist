{"id":"CVE-2022-1537","publishedDate":"2022-05-10T14:15:08.403","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"file.copy operations in GruntJS are vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition leading to arbitrary file write in GitHub repository gruntjs/grunt prior to 1.5.3. This vulnerability is capable of arbitrary file writes which can lead to local privilege escalation to the GruntJS user if a lower-privileged user has write access to both source and destination directories as the lower-privileged user can create a symlink to the GruntJS user's .bashrc file or replace /etc/shadow file if the GruntJS user is root.","references":["https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/commit/58016ffac5ed9338b63ecc2a63710f5027362bae","https://huntr.dev/bounties/0179c3e5-bc02-4fc9-8491-a1a319b51b4d","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00006.html","https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/commit/58016ffac5ed9338b63ecc2a63710f5027362bae","https://huntr.dev/bounties/0179c3e5-bc02-4fc9-8491-a1a319b51b4d","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00006.html"]}
