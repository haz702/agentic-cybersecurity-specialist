{"id":"CVE-2023-28625","publishedDate":"2023-04-03T14:15:07.507","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"mod_auth_openidc is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In versions 2.0.0 through 2.4.13.1, when `OIDCStripCookies` is set and a crafted cookie supplied, a NULL pointer dereference would occur, resulting in a segmentation fault. This could be used in a Denial-of-Service attack and thus presents an availability risk. Version 2.4.13.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using `OIDCStripCookies`.","references":["https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/blame/3f11976dab56af0a46a7dddb7a275cc16d6eb726/src/mod_auth_openidc.c#L178-L179","https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/commit/c0e1edac3c4c19988ccdc7713d7aebfce6ff916a","https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/releases/tag/v2.4.13.2","https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-f5xw-rvfr-24qr","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00034.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WIBKFC22PDH6UXMSZ23PHTD7736ZC7BB/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5405","https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/blame/3f11976dab56af0a46a7dddb7a275cc16d6eb726/src/mod_auth_openidc.c#L178-L179","https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/commit/c0e1edac3c4c19988ccdc7713d7aebfce6ff916a","https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/releases/tag/v2.4.13.2","https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-f5xw-rvfr-24qr","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00034.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WIBKFC22PDH6UXMSZ23PHTD7736ZC7BB/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5405"]}
