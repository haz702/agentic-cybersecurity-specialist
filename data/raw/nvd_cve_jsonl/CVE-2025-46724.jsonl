{"id":"CVE-2025-46724","publishedDate":"2025-05-20T18:15:46.430","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Langroid is a Python framework to build large language model (LLM)-powered applications. Prior to version 0.53.15, `TableChatAgent` uses `pandas eval()`. If fed by untrusted user input, like the case of a public-facing LLM application, it may be vulnerable to code injection. Langroid 0.53.15 sanitizes input to `TableChatAgent` by default to tackle the most common attack vectors, and added several warnings about the risky behavior in the project documentation.","references":["https://github.com/langroid/langroid/commit/0d9e4a7bb3ae2eef8d38f2e970ff916599a2b2a6","https://github.com/langroid/langroid/security/advisories/GHSA-jqq5-wc57-f8hj","https://github.com/langroid/langroid/security/advisories/GHSA-jqq5-wc57-f8hj"]}
