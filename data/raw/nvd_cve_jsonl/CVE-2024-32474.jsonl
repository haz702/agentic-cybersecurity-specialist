{"id":"CVE-2024-32474","publishedDate":"2024-04-18T20:15:17.733","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Prior to 24.4.1, when authenticating as a superuser to Sentry with a username and password, the password is leaked as cleartext in logs under the _event_: `auth-index.validate_superuser`. An attacker with access to the log data could use these leaked credentials to login to the Sentry system as superuser. Self-hosted users on affected versions should upgrade to 24.4.1 or later. Users can configure the logging level to exclude logs of the `INFO` level and only generate logs for levels at `WARNING` or more.","references":["https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/d5b34568d9f1c41362ccb62141532a0a2169512f","https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/66393","https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/69148","https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-6cjm-4pxw-7xp9","https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/d5b34568d9f1c41362ccb62141532a0a2169512f","https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/66393","https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/69148","https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-6cjm-4pxw-7xp9"]}
