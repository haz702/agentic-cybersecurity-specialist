{"id":"CVE-2024-48336","publishedDate":"2024-11-04T18:15:05.027","cvssV3":8.4,"description":"The install() function of ProviderInstaller.java in Magisk App before canary version 27007 does not verify the GMS app before loading it, which allows a local untrusted app with no additional privileges to silently execute arbitrary code in the Magisk app and escalate privileges to root via a crafted package, aka Bug #8279. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.","references":["https://github.com/canyie/MagiskEoP","https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/commit/c2eb6039579b8a2fb1e11a753cea7662c07bec02"]}
