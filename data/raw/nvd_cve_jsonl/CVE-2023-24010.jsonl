{"id":"CVE-2023-24010","publishedDate":"2025-01-09T15:15:11.467","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"An attacker can arbitrarily craft malicious DDS Participants (or ROS 2 Nodes) with valid certificates to compromise and get full control of the attacked secure DDS databus system by exploiting vulnerable attributes in the configuration of PKCS#7 certificate\u2019s validation. This is caused by a non-compliant implementation of permission document verification used by some DDS vendors. Specifically, an improper use of the OpenSSL PKCS7_verify function used to validate S/MIME signatures.","references":["https://gist.github.com/vmayoral/235c02d0b0ef85a29812eff6980ff80d","https://github.com/ros2/sros2/issues/282","https://gist.github.com/vmayoral/235c02d0b0ef85a29812eff6980ff80d"]}
