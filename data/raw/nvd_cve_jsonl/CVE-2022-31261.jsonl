{"id":"CVE-2022-31261","publishedDate":"2022-05-24T15:15:08.480","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An XXE issue was discovered in Morpheus through 5.2.16 and 5.4.x through 5.4.4. A successful attack requires a SAML identity provider to be configured. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must know the unique SAML callback ID of the configured identity source. A remote attacker can send a request crafted with an XXE payload to invoke a malicious DTD hosted on a system that they control. This results in reading local files that the application has access to.","references":["https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/5.4.4/release_notes/current.html","https://support.morpheusdata.com/s/?language=en_US","https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/5.4.4/release_notes/current.html","https://support.morpheusdata.com/s/?language=en_US"]}
