{"id":"CVE-2024-7957","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:38.130","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"An arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability exists in the ZulipConnector of danswer-ai/danswer, affecting the latest version. The vulnerability arises from the load_credentials method, where user-controlled input for realm_name and zuliprc_content is used to construct file paths and write file contents. This allows attackers to overwrite or create arbitrary files if a zuliprc- directory already exists in the temporary directory.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/21e9b909-036c-4544-ad35-6a5117836275"]}
