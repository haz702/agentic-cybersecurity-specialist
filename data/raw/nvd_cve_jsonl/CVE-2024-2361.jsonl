{"id":"CVE-2024-2361","publishedDate":"2024-05-16T09:15:10.060","cvssV3":9.6,"description":"A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms-webui allows for arbitrary file upload and read due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the issue resides in the `install_model()` function within `lollms_core/lollms/binding.py`, where the application fails to properly sanitize the `file://` protocol and other inputs, leading to arbitrary read and upload capabilities. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `path` and `variant_name` parameters to achieve path traversal, allowing for the reading of arbitrary files and uploading files to arbitrary locations on the server. This vulnerability affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/cd383817-924a-445a-838e-d0c867c6a176","https://huntr.com/bounties/cd383817-924a-445a-838e-d0c867c6a176"]}
