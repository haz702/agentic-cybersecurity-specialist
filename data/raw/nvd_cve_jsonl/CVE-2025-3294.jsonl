This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible assuming the files can be written to by the web server.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3269832%40wp-editor%2Ftrunk&old=3151053%40wp-editor%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9298820e-3753-41b3-8ba6-9fb494e215a8?source=cve"]}
