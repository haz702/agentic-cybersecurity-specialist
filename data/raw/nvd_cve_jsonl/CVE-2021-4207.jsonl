{"id":"CVE-2021-4207","publishedDate":"2022-04-29T17:15:20.100","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. A double fetch of guest controlled values `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2036966","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00008.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-27","https://starlabs.sg/advisories/21-4207/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5133","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2036966","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00008.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-27","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250321-0009/","https://starlabs.sg/advisories/21-4207/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5133"]}
