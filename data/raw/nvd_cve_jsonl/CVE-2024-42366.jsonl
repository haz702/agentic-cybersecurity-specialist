These vulnerabilities are patched in VRCX 2023.12.24. In addition to the patch, VRCX maintainers worked with the VRC team and blocked the older version of VRCX on the VRC's API side. Users who use the older version of VRCX must update their installation to continue using VRCX.","references":["https://github.com/vrcx-team/VRCX/commit/cd2387aa3289f936ce60049121c24b0765bd4180","https://github.com/vrcx-team/VRCX/security/advisories/GHSA-j98g-mgjm-wqph"]}
