{"id":"CVE-2022-22110","publishedDate":"2022-01-05T15:15:07.923","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In Daybyday CRM, versions 1.1 through 2.2.0 enforce weak password requirements in the user update functionality. A user with privileges to update his password could change it to a weak password, such as those with a length of a single character. This may allow an attacker to brute-force users\u2019 passwords with minimal to no computational effort.","references":["https://github.com/Bottelet/DaybydayCRM/commit/a0392f4a4a14e1e3fedaf6817aefce69b6bd661b","https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-22110","https://github.com/Bottelet/DaybydayCRM/commit/a0392f4a4a14e1e3fedaf6817aefce69b6bd661b","https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-22110"]}
