{"id":"CVE-2021-28878","publishedDate":"2021-04-11T20:15:12.813","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In the standard library in Rust before 1.52.0, the Zip implementation calls __iterator_get_unchecked() more than once for the same index (under certain conditions) when next_back() and next() are used together. This bug could lead to a memory safety violation due to an unmet safety requirement for the TrustedRandomAccess trait.","references":["https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82291","https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82292","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CZ337CM4GFJLRDFVQCGC7J25V65JXOG5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TFUO3URYCO73D2Q4WYJBWAMJWGGVXQO4/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VZG65GUW6Z2CYOQHF7T3TB5CZKIX6ZJE/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-09","https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/82291","https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/82292","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CZ337CM4GFJLRDFVQCGC7J25V65JXOG5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TFUO3URYCO73D2Q4WYJBWAMJWGGVXQO4/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VZG65GUW6Z2CYOQHF7T3TB5CZKIX6ZJE/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-09"]}
