{"id":"CVE-2024-37305","publishedDate":"2024-06-17T20:15:12.880","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"oqs-provider is a provider for the OpenSSL 3 cryptography library that adds support for post-quantum cryptography in TLS, X.509, and S/MIME using post-quantum algorithms from liboqs. Flaws have been identified in the way oqs-provider handles lengths decoded with DECODE_UINT32 at the start of serialized hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) keys and signatures. Unchecked length values are later used for memory reads and writes; malformed input can lead to crashes or information leakage. Handling of plain/non-hybrid PQ key operation is not affected. This issue has been patched in in v0.6.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.","references":["https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/416","https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/security/advisories/GHSA-pqvr-5cr8-v6fx","https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/416","https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/security/advisories/GHSA-pqvr-5cr8-v6fx"]}
