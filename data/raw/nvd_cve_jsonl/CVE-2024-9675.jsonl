Cache mounts do not properly validate that user-specified paths for the cache are within our cache directory, allowing a `RUN` instruction in a Container file to mount an arbitrary directory from the host (read/write) into the container as long as those files can be accessed by the user running Buildah.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8563","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8675","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8679","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8686","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8690","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8700","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8703","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8707","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8708","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8709","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8846","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8984","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8994","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9051","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9454","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9459","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2445","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2449","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2454","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2701","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2710","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:3301","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:3573","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9675","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2317458"]}
