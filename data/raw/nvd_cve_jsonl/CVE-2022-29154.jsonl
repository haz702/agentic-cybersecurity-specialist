{"id":"CVE-2022-29154","publishedDate":"2022-08-02T15:15:08.520","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote servers to write arbitrary files inside the directories of connecting peers. The server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient validation of file names. A malicious rsync server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rsync client target directory and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/02/1","https://github.com/WayneD/rsync/tags","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NMBOJ77A7T7PQCARMDUK75TE6LLESZ3O/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YRQAI7H4M4RQZ2IWZUEEXECBE5D56BH2/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/02/1","https://github.com/WayneD/rsync/tags","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NMBOJ77A7T7PQCARMDUK75TE6LLESZ3O/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YRQAI7H4M4RQZ2IWZUEEXECBE5D56BH2/"]}
