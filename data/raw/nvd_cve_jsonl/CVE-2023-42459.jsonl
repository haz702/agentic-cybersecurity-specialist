{"id":"CVE-2023-42459","publishedDate":"2023-10-16T21:15:10.923","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). In affected versions specific DATA submessages can be sent to a discovery locator which may trigger a free error. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process. The call to free() could potentially leave the pointer in the attackers control which could lead to a double free. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.12.0, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","references":["https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/issues/3207","https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/pull/3824","https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-gq8g-fj58-22gm","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5568","https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/issues/3207","https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/pull/3824","https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-gq8g-fj58-22gm","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5568"]}
