{"id":"CVE-2024-45592","publishedDate":"2024-09-10T16:15:21.550","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"auditor-bundle, formerly known as DoctrineAuditBundle, integrates auditor library into any Symfony 3.4+ application. Prior to version 5.2.6, there is an unescaped entity property enabling Javascript injection. This is possible because `%source_label%` in twig macro is not escaped. Therefore script tags can be inserted and are executed. The vulnerability is fixed in versions 6.0.0 and 5.2.6.","references":["https://github.com/DamienHarper/auditor-bundle/commit/42ba2940d8b99467de0c806ea5655cc1c6882cd1","https://github.com/DamienHarper/auditor-bundle/commit/e7deb377fa89677d44973b486d26d6a7374233ae","https://github.com/DamienHarper/auditor-bundle/security/advisories/GHSA-78vg-7v27-hj67"]}
