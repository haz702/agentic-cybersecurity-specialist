{"id":"CVE-2024-8507","publishedDate":"2024-10-16T07:15:16.277","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'mk_file_folder_manager' ajax action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://filemanagerpro.io/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/db70b37c-707a-47b8-a3a2-5a2b7d30de89?source=cve"]}
