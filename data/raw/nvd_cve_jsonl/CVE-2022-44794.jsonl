{"id":"CVE-2022-44794","publishedDate":"2022-11-07T04:15:09.493","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712. Management protocol has a flow which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary Bash code with root privileges. The command that sets the hostname doesn't validate input parameters. As a result, arbitrary data goes directly to the Bash interpreter. An attacker would need credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.","references":["https://objectfirst.com/security/of-20221024-0001/","https://objectfirst.com/security/of-20221024-0001/"]}
