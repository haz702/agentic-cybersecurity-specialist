{"id":"CVE-2023-28862","publishedDate":"2023-03-31T17:15:06.620","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in LemonLDAP::NG before 2.16.1. Weak session ID generation in the AuthBasic handler and incorrect failure handling during a password check allow attackers to bypass 2FA verification. Any plugin that tries to deny session creation after the store step does not deny an AuthBasic session.","references":["https://gitlab.ow2.org/lemonldap-ng/lemonldap-ng/-/issues/2896","https://gitlab.ow2.org/lemonldap-ng/lemonldap-ng/-/releases/v2.16.1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00018.html","https://gitlab.ow2.org/lemonldap-ng/lemonldap-ng/-/issues/2896","https://gitlab.ow2.org/lemonldap-ng/lemonldap-ng/-/releases/v2.16.1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00018.html"]}
