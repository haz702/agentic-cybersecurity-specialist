{"id":"CVE-2024-11350","publishedDate":"2025-01-08T09:15:06.460","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the adforest_reset_password() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/adforest-classified-wordpress-theme/19481695","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4ebb766a-44e9-460c-be84-356b7403e593?source=cve"]}
