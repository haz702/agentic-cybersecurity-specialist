{"id":"CVE-2021-21696","publishedDate":"2021-11-04T17:15:08.873","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier does not limit agent read/write access to the libs/ directory inside build directories when using the FilePath APIs, allowing attackers in control of agent processes to replace the code of a trusted library with a modified variant. This results in unsandboxed code execution in the Jenkins controller process.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/04/3","https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-11-04/#SECURITY-2423","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/04/3","https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-11-04/#SECURITY-2423"]}
