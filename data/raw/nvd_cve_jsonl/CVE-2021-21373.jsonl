{"id":"CVE-2021-21373","publishedDate":"2021-03-26T22:15:12.773","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Nimble is a package manager for the Nim programming language. In Nim release versions before versions 1.2.10 and 1.4.4, \"nimble refresh\" fetches a list of Nimble packages over HTTPS by default. In case of error it falls back to a non-TLS URL http://irclogs.nim-lang.org/packages.json. An attacker able to perform MitM can deliver a modified package list containing malicious software packages. If the packages are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted code execution.","references":["https://consensys.net/diligence/vulnerabilities/nim-insecure-ssl-tls-defaults-remote-code-execution/","https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/blob/master/changelog.markdown#0130","https://github.com/nim-lang/security/security/advisories/GHSA-8w52-r35x-rgp8","https://consensys.net/diligence/vulnerabilities/nim-insecure-ssl-tls-defaults-remote-code-execution/","https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/blob/master/changelog.markdown#0130","https://github.com/nim-lang/security/security/advisories/GHSA-8w52-r35x-rgp8"]}
