{"id":"CVE-2024-5548","publishedDate":"2024-06-27T18:15:20.733","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the stitionai/devika repository, specifically within the /api/download-project endpoint. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the 'project_name' parameter in a GET request to download arbitrary files from the system. This issue affects the latest version of the repository. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation in the 'download_project' function, allowing attackers to traverse the directory structure and access files outside the intended directory. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server.","references":["https://github.com/stitionai/devika/commit/6acce21fb08c3d1123ef05df6a33912bf0ee77c2","https://huntr.com/bounties/ad7dd135-8839-4042-87c0-105af61d262c","https://github.com/stitionai/devika/commit/6acce21fb08c3d1123ef05df6a33912bf0ee77c2","https://huntr.com/bounties/ad7dd135-8839-4042-87c0-105af61d262c"]}
