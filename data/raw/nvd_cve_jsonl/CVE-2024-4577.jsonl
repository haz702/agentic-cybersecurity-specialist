{"id":"CVE-2024-4577","publishedDate":"2024-06-09T20:15:09.550","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"In PHP versions\u00a08.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, when using Apache and PHP-CGI on Windows, if the system is set up to use certain code pages, Windows may use \"Best-Fit\" behavior to replace characters in command line given to\u00a0Win32 API functions. PHP CGI module may misinterpret those characters as PHP options, which may allow a malicious user to pass options to PHP binary being run, and thus reveal the source code of scripts, run arbitrary PHP code on the server, etc.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/07/1","https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/06/php-vulnerability-allows-attackers-to-run-malicious-code-on-windows-servers/","https://blog.orange.tw/2024/06/cve-2024-4577-yet-another-php-rce.html","https://cert.be/en/advisory/warning-php-remote-code-execution-patch-immediately","https://devco.re/blog/2024/06/06/security-alert-cve-2024-4577-php-cgi-argument-injection-vulnerability-en/","https://github.com/11whoami99/CVE-2024-4577","https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-3qgc-jrrr-25jv","https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/19247","https://github.com/watchtowrlabs/CVE-2024-4577","https://github.com/xcanwin/CVE-2024-4577-PHP-RCE","https://isc.sans.edu/diary/30994","https://labs.watchtowr.com/no-way-php-strikes-again-cve-2024-4577/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PKGTQUOA2NTZ3RXN22CSAUJPIRUYRB4B/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/W45DBOH56NQDRTOM2DN2LNA2FZIMC3PK/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0008/","https://www.imperva.com/blog/imperva-protects-against-critical-php-vulnerability-cve-2024-4577/","https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.1.29","https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.2.20","https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.3.8","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/07/1","https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/06/php-vulnerability-allows-attackers-to-run-malicious-code-on-windows-servers/","https://blog.orange.tw/2024/06/cve-2024-4577-yet-another-php-rce.html","https://blog.talosintelligence.com/new-persistent-attacks-japan/","https://cert.be/en/advisory/warning-php-remote-code-execution-patch-immediately","https://devco.re/blog/2024/06/06/security-alert-cve-2024-4577-php-cgi-argument-injection-vulnerability-en/","https://github.com/11whoami99/CVE-2024-4577","https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-3qgc-jrrr-25jv","https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/19247","https://github.com/watchtowrlabs/CVE-2024-4577","https://github.com/xcanwin/CVE-2024-4577-PHP-RCE","https://isc.sans.edu/diary/30994","https://labs.watchtowr.com/no-way-php-strikes-again-cve-2024-4577/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PKGTQUOA2NTZ3RXN22CSAUJPIRUYRB4B/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/W45DBOH56NQDRTOM2DN2LNA2FZIMC3PK/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0008/","https://www.imperva.com/blog/imperva-protects-against-critical-php-vulnerability-cve-2024-4577/","https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.1.29","https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.2.20","https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.3.8","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/php-cgi-argument-injection-to-rce-cve-2024-4577","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/php-cgi-os-command-injection-vulnerability-cve-2024-4577"]}
