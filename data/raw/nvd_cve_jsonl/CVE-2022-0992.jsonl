{"id":"CVE-2022-0992","publishedDate":"2022-04-19T21:15:13.623","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The SiteGround Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows unauthenticated users to log in as administrative users due to missing identity verification on initial 2FA set-up that allows unauthenticated and unauthorized users to configure 2FA for pending accounts. Upon successful configuration, the attacker is logged in as that user without access to a username/password pair which is the expected first form of authentication. This affects versions up to, and including, 1.2.5.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2706302","https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2022/04/critical-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-patched-in-siteground-security-plugin/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6e5c6bf7-a653-4571-9566-574d2bb35c4f?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2706302","https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2022/04/critical-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-patched-in-siteground-security-plugin/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6e5c6bf7-a653-4571-9566-574d2bb35c4f?source=cve"]}
