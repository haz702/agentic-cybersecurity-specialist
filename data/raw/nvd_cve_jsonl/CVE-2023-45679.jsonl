{"id":"CVE-2023-45679","publishedDate":"2023-10-21T00:15:09.477","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis files. A crafted file may trigger memory allocation failure in `start_decoder`. In that case the function returns early, but some of the pointers in `f->comment_list` are left initialized and later `setup_free` is called on these pointers in `vorbis_deinit`. This issue may lead to code execution.","references":["https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_vorbis.c#L3660-L3677","https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_vorbis.c#L4208-L4215","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-145_GHSL-2023-151_stb_image_h/","https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_vorbis.c#L3660-L3677","https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_vorbis.c#L4208-L4215","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-145_GHSL-2023-151_stb_image_h/"]}
