{"id":"CVE-2022-3509","publishedDate":"2022-12-12T13:15:14.607","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A parsing issue similar to CVE-2022-3171, but with textformat in protobuf-java core and lite versions prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and 3.16.3 can lead to a denial of service attack. Inputs containing multiple instances of non-repeated embedded messages with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection pauses. We recommend updating to the versions mentioned above.","references":["https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/a3888f53317a8018e7a439bac4abeb8f3425d5e9","https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/commit/a3888f53317a8018e7a439bac4abeb8f3425d5e9"]}
