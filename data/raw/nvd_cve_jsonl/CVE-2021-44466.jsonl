{"id":"CVE-2021-44466","publishedDate":"2021-12-30T22:15:09.957","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"Bitmask Riseup VPN 0.21.6 contains a local privilege escalation flaw due to improper access controls. When the software is installed with a non-default installation directory off of the system root, the installer fails to properly set ACLs. This allows lower privileged users to replace the VPN executable with a malicious one. When a higher privileged user such as an Administrator launches that executable, it is possible for the lower privileged user to escalate to Administrator privileges.","references":["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-58","https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-58"]}
