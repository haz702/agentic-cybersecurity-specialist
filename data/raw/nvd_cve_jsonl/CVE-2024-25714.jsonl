{"id":"CVE-2024-25714","publishedDate":"2024-02-11T03:15:09.393","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"In Rhonabwy through 1.1.13, HMAC signature verification uses a strcmp function that is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, because it stops the comparison when the first difference is spotted in the two signatures. (The fix uses gnutls_memcmp, which has constant-time execution.)","references":["https://github.com/babelouest/rhonabwy/commit/f9fd9a1c77e48b514ebb3baf0360f87eef3d846e","https://github.com/babelouest/rhonabwy/commit/f9fd9a1c77e48b514ebb3baf0360f87eef3d846e"]}
