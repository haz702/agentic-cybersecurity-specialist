This could lead to an OoB\nread.\n\nMove the wDatagramIndex term to the other side of the inequality.\n\nAn existing condition ensures that wDatagramIndex < urb->actual_length.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/18bf6f5cce3172cb303c3f0551aa9443d5ed74f8","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c219427ed296f94bb4b91d08626776dc7719ee27","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d677e7dd59ad6837496f5a02d8e5d39824278dfd","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d824a964185910e317287f034c0a439c08b4fe49"]}
