{"id":"CVE-2022-41318","publishedDate":"2022-12-25T19:15:10.820","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"A buffer over-read was discovered in libntlmauth in Squid 2.5 through 5.6. Due to incorrect integer-overflow protection, the SSPI and SMB authentication helpers are vulnerable to reading unintended memory locations. In some configurations, cleartext credentials from these locations are sent to a client. This is fixed in 5.7.","references":["http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/SQUID-2022_2.patch","http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/changesets/SQUID-2022_2.patch","https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-394c-rr7q-6g78","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/09/23/2","http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/SQUID-2022_2.patch","http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/changesets/SQUID-2022_2.patch","https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-394c-rr7q-6g78","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/09/23/2"]}
