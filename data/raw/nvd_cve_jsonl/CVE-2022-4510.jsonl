{"id":"CVE-2022-4510","publishedDate":"2023-01-26T21:18:06.547","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A path traversal vulnerability was identified in ReFirm Labs binwalk from version 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included. By crafting a malicious PFS filesystem file, an attacker can get binwalk's PFS extractor to extract files at arbitrary locations when binwalk is run in extraction mode (-e option). Remote code execution can be achieved by building a PFS filesystem that, upon extraction,\u00a0would extract a malicious binwalk module into the folder .config/binwalk/plugins.\n This vulnerability is associated with program files src/binwalk/plugins/unpfs.py.\n\nThis issue affects binwalk from 2.1.2b through 2.3.3 included.","references":["https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/617","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-07","https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk/pull/617","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-07"]}
