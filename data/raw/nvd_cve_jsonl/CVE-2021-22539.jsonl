{"id":"CVE-2021-22539","publishedDate":"2021-04-16T11:15:12.637","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"An attacker can place a crafted JSON config file into the project folder pointing to a custom executable. VScode-bazel allows the workspace path to lint *.bzl files to be set via this config file. As such the attacker is able to execute any executable on the system through vscode-bazel. We recommend upgrading to version 0.4.1 or above.","references":["https://github.com/bazelbuild/vscode-bazel-ghsa-2rcw-j8x4-hgcv/pull/1","https://github.com/bazelbuild/vscode-bazel/security/advisories/GHSA-2rcw-j8x4-hgcv","https://github.com/bazelbuild/vscode-bazel-ghsa-2rcw-j8x4-hgcv/pull/1","https://github.com/bazelbuild/vscode-bazel/security/advisories/GHSA-2rcw-j8x4-hgcv"]}
