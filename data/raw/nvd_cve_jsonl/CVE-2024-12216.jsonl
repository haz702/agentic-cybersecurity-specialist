{"id":"CVE-2024-12216","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:27.450","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"A vulnerability in the `ImageClassificationDataset.from_csv()` API of the `dmlc/gluon-cv` repository, version 0.10.0, allows for arbitrary file write. The function downloads and extracts `tar.gz` files from URLs without proper sanitization, making it susceptible to a TarSlip vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious tar files that, when extracted, can overwrite files on the victim's system via path traversal or faked symlinks.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/46081fdc-2951-4deb-a2c9-2627007bdce0"]}
