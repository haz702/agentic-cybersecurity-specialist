{"id":"CVE-2020-10275","publishedDate":"2020-06-24T05:15:13.193","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The access tokens for the REST API are directly derived from the publicly available default credentials for the web interface. Given a USERNAME and a PASSWORD, the token string is generated directly with base64(USERNAME:sha256(PASSWORD)). An unauthorized attacker inside the network can use the default credentials to compute the token and interact with the REST API to exfiltrate, infiltrate or delete data.","references":["https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/2565","https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/2565"]}
