{"id":"CVE-2024-2948","publishedDate":"2024-03-30T08:15:07.330","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The Favorites plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'user_favorites' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as 'no_favorites'. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3061244%40favorites&new=3061244%40favorites&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/38a87046-9a46-40c2-b10d-d1a7d5ef8742?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3061244%40favorites&new=3061244%40favorites&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/38a87046-9a46-40c2-b10d-d1a7d5ef8742?source=cve"]}
