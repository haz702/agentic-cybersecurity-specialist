{"id":"CVE-2020-7766","publishedDate":"2020-11-10T16:15:14.963","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"This affects all versions of package json-ptr. The issue occurs in the set operation (https://flitbit.github.io/json-ptr/classes/_src_pointer_.jsonpointer.htmlset) when the force flag is set to true. The function recursively set the property in the target object, however it does not properly check the key being set, leading to a prototype pollution.","references":["https://github.com/flitbit/json-ptr/blob/master/src/util.ts%23L174","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1038396","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JSONPTR-1016939","https://github.com/flitbit/json-ptr/blob/master/src/util.ts%23L174","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1038396","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JSONPTR-1016939"]}
