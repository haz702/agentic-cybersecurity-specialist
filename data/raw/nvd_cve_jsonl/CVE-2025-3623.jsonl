{"id":"CVE-2025-3623","publishedDate":"2025-05-14T03:15:33.073","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The Uncanny Automator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.0.1 via deserialization of untrusted input in the automator_api_decode_message() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files.","references":["https://automatorplugin.com/knowledge-base/uncanny-automator-changelog/#6-4-0-2-2025-04-18","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/uncanny-automator/trunk/src/core/lib/helpers/class-automator-recipe-helpers.php#L540","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3276577/uncanny-automator/trunk/src/core/lib/helpers/class-automator-recipe-helpers.php","https://wordpress.org/plugins/uncanny-automator/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/00bcfd8f-9785-449a-a0ea-16e2583d684a?source=cve"]}
