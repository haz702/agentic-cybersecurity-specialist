{"id":"CVE-2021-3311","publishedDate":"2021-02-05T14:15:19.153","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in October through build 471. It reactivates an old session ID (which had been invalid after a logout) once a new login occurs. NOTE: this violates the intended Auth/Manager.php authentication behavior but, admittedly, is only relevant if an old session ID is known to an attacker.","references":["https://anisiosantos.me/october-cms-token-reactivation","https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/642f597489e6f644d4bd9a0c267e864cabead024","https://octobercms.com/forum/chan/announcements","https://anisiosantos.me/october-cms-token-reactivation","https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/642f597489e6f644d4bd9a0c267e864cabead024","https://octobercms.com/forum/chan/announcements"]}
