{"id":"CVE-2023-6971","publishedDate":"2023-12-23T02:15:45.150","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in versions 1.0.8 to 1.3.9 via the 'content-dir' HTTP header. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include remote files on the server, resulting in code execution. NOTE: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the target server's php.ini is configured with 'allow_url_include' set to 'on'. This feature is deprecated as of PHP 7.4 and is disabled by default, but can still be explicitly enabled in later versions of PHP.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/backup-backup/tags/1.3.9/includes/backup-heart.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3012745/backup-backup","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b380283c-0dbb-4d67-9f66-cb7c400c0427?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/backup-backup/tags/1.3.9/includes/backup-heart.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3012745/backup-backup","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b380283c-0dbb-4d67-9f66-cb7c400c0427?source=cve"]}
