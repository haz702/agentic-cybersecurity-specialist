{"id":"CVE-2022-2540","publishedDate":"2022-09-06T18:15:14.317","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Link Optimizer Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 1.4.5. This is due to missing nonce validation on the admin_page function found in the ~/admin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/link-optimizer-lite/1.4.5/admin.php#L20","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ca64692b-b194-4ceb-975e-72e4041252f2?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2540","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/link-optimizer-lite/1.4.5/admin.php#L20","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ca64692b-b194-4ceb-975e-72e4041252f2?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2540"]}
