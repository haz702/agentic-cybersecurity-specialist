{"id":"CVE-2021-41286","publishedDate":"2021-10-05T16:15:07.553","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Omikron MultiCash Desktop 4.00.008.SP5 relies on a client-side authentication mechanism. When a user logs into the application, the validity of the password is checked locally. All communication to the database backend is made via the same technical account. Consequently, an attacker can attach a debugger to the process or create a patch that manipulates the behavior of the login function. When the function always returns the success value (corresponding to a correct password), an attacker can login with any desired account, such as the administrative account of the application.","references":["https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2021-047.txt","https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2021-047.txt"]}
