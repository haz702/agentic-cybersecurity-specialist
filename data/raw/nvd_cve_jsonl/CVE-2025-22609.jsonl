{"id":"CVE-2025-22609","publishedDate":"2025-01-24T17:15:15.100","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.361, the missing authorization allows any authenticated user to attach any existing private key on a coolify instance to his own server. If the server configuration of IP / domain, port (most likely 22) and user (root) matches with the victim's server configuration, then the attacker can use the `Terminal` feature and execute arbitrary commands on the victim's server. Version 4.0.0-beta.361 fixes the issue.","references":["https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/security/advisories/GHSA-3w2c-jfr2-9pg9"]}
