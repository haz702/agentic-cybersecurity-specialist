{"id":"CVE-2022-49711","publishedDate":"2025-02-26T07:01:46.893","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: fsl-mc-bus: fix KASAN use-after-free in fsl_mc_bus_remove()\n\nIn fsl_mc_bus_remove(), mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io is passed to\nfsl_destroy_mc_io(). However, mc->root_mc_bus_dev is already freed in\nfsl_mc_device_remove(). Then reference to mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io\ntriggers KASAN use-after-free. To avoid the use-after-free, keep the\nreference to mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io in a local variable and pass to\nfsl_destroy_mc_io().\n\nThis patch needs rework to apply to kernels older than v5.15.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/161b68b0a728377aaa10a8e14c70e7734f3c9ff7","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/928ea98252ad75118950941683893cf904541da9","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ccd1751092341ac120a961835211f9f2e3735963"]}
