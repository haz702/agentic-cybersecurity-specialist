{"id":"CVE-2023-25156","publishedDate":"2023-02-15T15:15:11.533","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, does not impose rate limits in versions prior to 12.0. This makes it easier to attempt brute-force attacks against the login page. Users should upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive a patch. As a workaround, users may install and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS.","references":["https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/0ed213fa0ddb7a6dc77e3c3b99e8fc90ccdaf46f","https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-7968-h4m4-ghm9","https://huntr.dev/bounties/2b1a9be9-45e9-490b-8de0-26a492e79795/","https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/02/15/kiwi-tcms-120/","https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/0ed213fa0ddb7a6dc77e3c3b99e8fc90ccdaf46f","https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-7968-h4m4-ghm9","https://huntr.dev/bounties/2b1a9be9-45e9-490b-8de0-26a492e79795/","https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/02/15/kiwi-tcms-120/"]}
