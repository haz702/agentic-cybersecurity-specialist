{"id":"CVE-2024-37903","publishedDate":"2024-07-05T18:15:32.093","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"Mastodon is a self-hosted, federated microblogging platform. Starting in version 2.6.0 and prior to versions 4.1.18 and 4.2.10, by crafting specific activities, an attacker can extend the audience of a post they do not own to other Mastodon users on a target server, thus gaining access to the contents of a post not intended for them. Versions 4.1.18 and 4.2.10 contain a patch for this issue.","references":["https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/a1c7aae28aecf06659c5b18cfa131b37cd1512a3","https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/d4bf22b632ea8b1174375c4966a6768ab66393b6","https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.18","https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.2.10","https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3","https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/a1c7aae28aecf06659c5b18cfa131b37cd1512a3","https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/d4bf22b632ea8b1174375c4966a6768ab66393b6","https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.18","https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.2.10","https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-xjvf-fm67-4qc3"]}
