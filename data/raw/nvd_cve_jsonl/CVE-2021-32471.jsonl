{"id":"CVE-2021-32471","publishedDate":"2021-05-10T05:15:06.640","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Insufficient input validation in the Marvin Minsky 1967 implementation of the Universal Turing Machine allows program users to execute arbitrary code via crafted data. For example, a tape head may have an unexpected location after the processing of input composed of As and Bs (instead of 0s and 1s). NOTE: the discoverer states \"this vulnerability has no real-world implications.\"","references":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02124","https://github.com/intrinsic-propensity/turing-machine","https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02124","https://github.com/intrinsic-propensity/turing-machine"]}
