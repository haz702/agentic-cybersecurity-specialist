{"id":"CVE-2024-38517","publishedDate":"2024-07-09T19:15:12.470","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Tencent RapidJSON is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to an integer underflow in the `GenericReader::ParseNumber()` function of `include/rapidjson/reader.h` when parsing JSON text from a stream. An attacker needs to send the victim a crafted file which needs to be opened; this triggers the integer underflow vulnerability (when the file is parsed), leading to elevation of privilege.","references":["https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/pull/1261/commits/8269bc2bc289e9d343bae51cdf6d23ef0950e001","https://github.com/fmalita/rapidjson/commit/8269bc2bc289e9d343bae51cdf6d23ef0950e001","https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38517","https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson/pull/1261/commits/8269bc2bc289e9d343bae51cdf6d23ef0950e001","https://github.com/fmalita/rapidjson/commit/8269bc2bc289e9d343bae51cdf6d23ef0950e001","https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38517","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240905-0001/"]}
