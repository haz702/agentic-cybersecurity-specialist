{"id":"CVE-2025-0429","publishedDate":"2025-01-22T08:15:09.173","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The \"AI Power: Complete AI Pack\" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 1.8.96 via deserialization of untrusted input from the $form['post_content'] variable through the wpaicg_export_ai_forms() function. This allows authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3224162/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/bb927aba-a96d-47b9-ba35-60945ea5cfe5?source=cve"]}
