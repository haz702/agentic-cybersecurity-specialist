{"id":"CVE-2020-36669","publishedDate":"2023-03-07T14:15:09.357","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The JetBackup \u2013 WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.3.9. This is due to missing nonce validation on the backup_guard_get_import_backup() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the vulnerable site's server via a forged request, granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2341420","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9ae8de00-ba4c-48d2-a566-13dac0bc4312","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2341420","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9ae8de00-ba4c-48d2-a566-13dac0bc4312"]}
