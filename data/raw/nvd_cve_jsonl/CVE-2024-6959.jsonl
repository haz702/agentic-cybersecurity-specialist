{"id":"CVE-2024-6959","publishedDate":"2024-10-13T13:15:10.880","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"A vulnerability in parisneo/lollms-webui version 9.8 allows for a Denial of Service (DOS) attack when uploading an audio file. If an attacker appends a large number of characters to the end of a multipart boundary, the system will continuously process each character, rendering lollms-webui inaccessible. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, enabling remote exploitation. The vulnerability leads to service disruption, resource exhaustion, and extended downtime.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/6394d32e-f35c-418a-95b8-e7254ed0bc8e"]}
