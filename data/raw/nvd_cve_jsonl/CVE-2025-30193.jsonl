{"id":"CVE-2025-30193","publishedDate":"2025-05-20T12:15:19.697","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In some circumstances, when DNSdist is configured to allow an unlimited number of queries on a single, incoming TCP connection from a client, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a TCP exchange that triggers an exhaustion of the stack and a crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service.\n\nThe remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.10 version.\n\nA workaround is to restrict the maximum number of queries on incoming TCP connections to a safe value, like 50, via the setMaxTCPQueriesPerConnection setting.\n\nWe would like to thank Renaud Allard for bringing this issue to our attention.","references":["https://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2025-03.html"]}
