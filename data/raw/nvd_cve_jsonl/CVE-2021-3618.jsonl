{"id":"CVE-2021-3618","publishedDate":"2022-03-23T20:15:09.833","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"ALPACA is an application layer protocol content confusion attack, exploiting TLS servers implementing different protocols but using compatible certificates, such as multi-domain or wildcard certificates. A MiTM attacker having access to victim's traffic at the TCP/IP layer can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session. This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of one protocol service may compromise the other at the application layer.","references":["https://alpaca-attack.com/","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1975623","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00031.html","https://alpaca-attack.com/","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1975623","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00031.html"]}
