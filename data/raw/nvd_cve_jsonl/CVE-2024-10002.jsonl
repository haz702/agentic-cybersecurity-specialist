{"id":"CVE-2024-10002","publishedDate":"2024-10-22T05:15:03.513","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Rover IDX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.0.0.2905. This is due to insufficient validation and capability check on the 'rover_idx_refresh_social_callback' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in to administrator. The vulnerability is partially patched in version 3.0.0.2905 and fully patched in version 3.0.0.2906.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/rover-idx/tags/3.0.0.2903/admin/rover-panel-social.php#L153","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/rover-idx/tags/3.0.0.2903/rover-social-common.php#L148","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3173032/rover-idx/trunk/rover-social-common.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5cf6a9fb-3c3b-48ad-a39b-77a529b89901?source=cve"]}
