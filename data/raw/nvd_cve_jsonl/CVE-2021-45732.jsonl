{"id":"CVE-2021-45732","publishedDate":"2021-12-30T22:15:10.063","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Netgear Nighthawk R6700 version 1.0.4.120 makes use of a hardcoded credential. It does not appear that normal users are intended to be able to manipulate configuration backups due to the fact that they are encrypted/obfuscated. By extracting the configuration using readily available public tools, a user can reconfigure settings not intended to be manipulated, repackage the configuration, and restore a backup causing these settings to be changed.","references":["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-57","https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-57"]}
