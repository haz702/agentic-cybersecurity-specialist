{"id":"CVE-2024-47777","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:40.700","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been identified in the gst_wavparse_smpl_chunk function within gstwavparse.c. This function attempts to read 4 bytes from the data + 12 offset without checking if the size of the data buffer is sufficient. If the buffer is too small, the function reads beyond its bounds. This vulnerability may result in reading 4 bytes out of the boundaries of the data buffer. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8042.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0027.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-259_Gstreamer/"]}
