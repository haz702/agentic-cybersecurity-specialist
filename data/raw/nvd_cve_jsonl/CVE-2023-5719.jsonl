{"id":"CVE-2023-5719","publishedDate":"2023-11-06T20:15:07.950","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"\nThe Crimson 3.2 Windows-based configuration tool allows users with administrative access to define new passwords for users and to download the resulting security configuration to a device. If such a password contains the percent (%) character, invalid values will be included, potentially truncating the string if a NUL is encountered. If the simplified password is not detected by the administrator, the device might be left in a vulnerable state as a result of more-easily compromised credentials. Note that passwords entered via the Crimson system web server do not suffer from this vulnerability.\n\n","references":["https://support.redlion.net/hc/en-us/categories/360002087671-Security-Advisories","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-306-01","https://support.redlion.net/hc/en-us/categories/360002087671-Security-Advisories","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-306-01"]}
