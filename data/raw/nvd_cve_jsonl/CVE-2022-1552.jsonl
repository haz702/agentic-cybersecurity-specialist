{"id":"CVE-2022-1552","publishedDate":"2022-08-31T16:15:09.867","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A flaw was found in PostgreSQL. There is an issue with incomplete efforts to operate safely when a privileged user is maintaining another user's objects. The Autovacuum, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, CLUSTER, and pg_amcheck commands activated relevant protections too late or not at all during the process. This flaw allows an attacker with permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema to execute arbitrary SQL functions under a superuser identity.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1552","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2081126","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202211-04","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0005/","https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-143-137-1211-1116-and-1021-released-2449/","https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2022-1552/","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1552","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2081126","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202211-04","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0005/","https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-143-137-1211-1116-and-1021-released-2449/","https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2022-1552/"]}
