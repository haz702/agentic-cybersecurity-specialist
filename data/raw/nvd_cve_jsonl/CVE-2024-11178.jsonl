{"id":"CVE-2024-11178","publishedDate":"2024-12-06T07:15:05.460","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The Login With OTP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.4.2. This is due to the plugin generating too weak OTP, and there\u2019s no attempt or time limit. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate and brute force the 6-digit numeric OTP that makes it possible to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/otp-login/tags/1.4.2/lib/otpl-class.php#L293","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/otp-login/tags/1.4.2/lib/otpl-class.php#L317","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d3775d48-5985-475e-8fb9-c4c5fd044772?source=cve"]}
