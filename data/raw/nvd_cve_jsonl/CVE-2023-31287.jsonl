{"id":"CVE-2023-31287","publishedDate":"2023-04-27T03:15:10.200","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in Serenity Serene (and StartSharp) before 6.7.0. Password reset links are sent by email. A link contains a token that is used to reset the password. This token remains valid even after the password reset and can be used a second time to change the password of the corresponding user. The token expires only 3 hours after issuance and is sent as a query parameter when resetting. An attacker with access to the browser history can thus use the token again to change the password in order to take over the account.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172648/Serenity-StartSharp-Software-File-Upload-XSS-User-Enumeration-Reusable-Tokens.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/May/14","https://github.com/serenity-is/Serenity/commit/11b9d267f840513d04b4f4d4876de7823a6e48d2","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172648/Serenity-StartSharp-Software-File-Upload-XSS-User-Enumeration-Reusable-Tokens.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/May/14","https://github.com/serenity-is/Serenity/commit/11b9d267f840513d04b4f4d4876de7823a6e48d2","https://packetstorm.news/files/id/172648"]}
