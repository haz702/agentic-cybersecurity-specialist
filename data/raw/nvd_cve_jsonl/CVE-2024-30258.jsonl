{"id":"CVE-2024-30258","publishedDate":"2024-05-14T15:22:15.163","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"FastDDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). Prior to versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, when a publisher serves a malformed `RTPS` packet, the subscriber crashes when creating `pthread`. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process, potentially leading to a DOS attack. Versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a patch for the issue.\n","references":["https://drive.google.com/file/d/19W5UC52hPnAqVq_boZWO45d1TJ4WoCSh/view?usp=sharing","https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/commit/65236f93e9c4ea3ff9a49fba4dfd9e43eb94037b","https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-53xw-465j-rxfh","https://drive.google.com/file/d/19W5UC52hPnAqVq_boZWO45d1TJ4WoCSh/view?usp=sharing","https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/commit/65236f93e9c4ea3ff9a49fba4dfd9e43eb94037b","https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/security/advisories/GHSA-53xw-465j-rxfh"]}
