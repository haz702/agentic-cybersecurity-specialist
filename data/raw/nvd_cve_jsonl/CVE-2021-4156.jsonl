{"id":"CVE-2021-4156","publishedDate":"2022-03-23T20:15:10.097","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in libsndfile's FLAC codec functionality. An attacker who is able to submit a specially crafted file (via tricking a user to open or otherwise) to an application linked with libsndfile and using the FLAC codec, could trigger an out-of-bounds read that would most likely cause a crash but could potentially leak memory information that could be used in further exploitation of other flaws.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2027690","https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/issues/731","https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/pull/732/commits/4c30646abf7834e406f7e2429c70bc254e18beab","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/06/msg00020.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00036.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-11","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2027690","https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/issues/731","https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile/pull/732/commits/4c30646abf7834e406f7e2429c70bc254e18beab","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/06/msg00020.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00036.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-11"]}
