{"id":"CVE-2024-38525","publishedDate":"2024-06-28T22:15:02.567","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"dd-trace-cpp is the Datadog distributed tracing for C++. When the library fails to extract trace context due to malformed unicode, it logs the list of audited headers and their values using the `nlohmann` JSON library. However, due to the way the JSON library is invoked, it throws an uncaught exception, which results in a crash. This vulnerability has been patched in version 0.2.2.","references":["https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/releases/tag/v0.2.2","https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/security/advisories/GHSA-rf3p-mg22-qv6w","https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/releases/tag/v0.2.2","https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-cpp/security/advisories/GHSA-rf3p-mg22-qv6w"]}
