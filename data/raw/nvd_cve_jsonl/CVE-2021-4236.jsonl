{"id":"CVE-2021-4236","publishedDate":"2022-12-27T22:15:12.013","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Web Sockets do not execute any AuthenticateMethod methods which may be set, leading to a nil pointer dereference if the returned UserData pointer is assumed to be non-nil, or authentication bypass. This issue only affects WebSockets with an AuthenticateMethod hook. Request handlers that do not explicitly use WebSockets are not vulnerable.","references":["https://github.com/ecnepsnai/web/commit/5a78f8d5c41ce60dcf9f61aaf47a7a8dc3e0002f","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2021-0107","https://github.com/ecnepsnai/web/commit/5a78f8d5c41ce60dcf9f61aaf47a7a8dc3e0002f","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2021-0107"]}
