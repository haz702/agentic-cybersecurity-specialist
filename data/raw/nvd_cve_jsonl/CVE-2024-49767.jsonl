{"id":"CVE-2024-49767","publishedDate":"2024-10-25T20:15:04.530","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Werkzeug is a Web Server Gateway Interface web application library. Applications using `werkzeug.formparser.MultiPartParser` corresponding to a version of Werkzeug prior to 3.0.6 to parse `multipart/form-data` requests (e.g. all flask applications) are vulnerable to a relatively simple but effective resource exhaustion (denial of service) attack. A specifically crafted form submission request can cause the parser to allocate and block 3 to 8 times the upload size in main memory. There is no upper limit; a single upload at 1 Gbit/s can exhaust 32 GB of RAM in less than 60 seconds. Werkzeug version 3.0.6 fixes this issue.","references":["https://github.com/pallets/quart/commit/5e78c4169b8eb66b91ead3e62d44721b9e1644ee","https://github.com/pallets/quart/commit/abb04a512496206de279225340ed022852fbf51f","https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/50cfeebcb0727e18cc52ffbeb125f4a66551179b","https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/releases/tag/3.0.6","https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/security/advisories/GHSA-q34m-jh98-gwm2","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250103-0007/"]}
