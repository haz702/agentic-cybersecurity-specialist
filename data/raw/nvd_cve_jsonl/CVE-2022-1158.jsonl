{"id":"CVE-2022-1158","publishedDate":"2022-08-05T17:15:08.017","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A flaw was found in KVM. When updating a guest's page table entry, vm_pgoff was improperly used as the offset to get the page's pfn. As vaddr and vm_pgoff are controllable by user-mode processes, this flaw allows unprivileged local users on the host to write outside the userspace region and potentially corrupt the kernel, resulting in a denial of service condition.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2069793","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230214-0003/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/08/4","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2069793","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230214-0003/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/08/4"]}
