{"id":"CVE-2022-29181","publishedDate":"2022-05-20T19:15:08.203","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"Nokogiri is an open source XML and HTML library for Ruby. Nokogiri prior to version 1.13.6 does not type-check all inputs into the XML and HTML4 SAX parsers, allowing specially crafted untrusted inputs to cause illegal memory access errors (segfault) or reads from unrelated memory. Version 1.13.6 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, ensure the untrusted input is a `String` by calling `#to_s` or equivalent.","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Dec/23","https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/commit/db05ba9a1bd4b90aa6c76742cf6102a7c7297267","https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/releases/tag/v1.13.6","https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-xh29-r2w5-wx8m","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-29","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-031_GHSL-2022-032_Nokogiri/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213532","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Dec/23","https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/commit/db05ba9a1bd4b90aa6c76742cf6102a7c7297267","https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/releases/tag/v1.13.6","https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-xh29-r2w5-wx8m","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-29","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-031_GHSL-2022-032_Nokogiri/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213532"]}
