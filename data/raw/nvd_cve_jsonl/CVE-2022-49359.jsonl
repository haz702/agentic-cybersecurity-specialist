{"id":"CVE-2022-49359","publishedDate":"2025-02-26T07:01:12.583","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panfrost: Job should reference MMU not file_priv\n\nFor a while now it's been allowed for a MMU context to outlive it's\ncorresponding panfrost_priv, however the job structure still references\npanfrost_priv to get hold of the MMU context. If panfrost_priv has been\nfreed this is a use-after-free which I've been able to trigger resulting\nin a splat.\n\nTo fix this, drop the reference to panfrost_priv in the job structure\nand add a direct reference to the MMU structure which is what's actually\nneeded.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/472dd7ea5e19a1aeabf1711ddc756777e05ee7c2","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6e516faf04317db2c46cbec4e3b78b4653a5b109","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8c8e8cc91a6ffc79865108279a74fd57d9070a17"]}
