{"id":"CVE-2024-1902","publishedDate":"2024-04-10T17:15:53.680","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"lunary-ai/lunary is vulnerable to a session reuse attack, allowing a removed user to change the organization name without proper authorization. The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation to check if a user is still part of an organization before allowing them to make changes. An attacker can exploit this by using an old authorization token to send a PATCH request, modifying the organization's name even after being removed from the organization. This issue is due to incorrect synchronization and affects the orgs.patch route.","references":["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/d8e2e73efd53ab4e92cf47bbf4b639a9f08853d2","https://huntr.com/bounties/e536310e-abe7-4585-9cf6-21f77390a5e8","https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/d8e2e73efd53ab4e92cf47bbf4b639a9f08853d2","https://huntr.com/bounties/e536310e-abe7-4585-9cf6-21f77390a5e8"]}
