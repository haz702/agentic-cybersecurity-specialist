{"id":"CVE-2020-15271","publishedDate":"2020-10-26T18:15:14.480","cvssV3":9.3,"description":"In lookatme (python/pypi package) versions prior to 2.3.0, the package automatically loaded the built-in \"terminal\" and \"file_loader\" extensions. Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.","references":["https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/commit/72fe36b784b234548d49dae60b840c37f0eb8d84","https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/pull/110","https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/releases/tag/v2.3.0","https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/security/advisories/GHSA-c84h-w6cr-5v8q","https://pypi.org/project/lookatme/#history","https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/commit/72fe36b784b234548d49dae60b840c37f0eb8d84","https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/pull/110","https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/releases/tag/v2.3.0","https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/security/advisories/GHSA-c84h-w6cr-5v8q","https://pypi.org/project/lookatme/#history"]}
