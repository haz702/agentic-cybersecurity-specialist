{"id":"CVE-2024-34707","publishedDate":"2024-05-14T15:39:30.633","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`, and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint. Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`) but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS). The vulnerability is fixed in Nautobot 1.6.22 and 2.2.4.","references":["https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/4f0a66bd6307bfe0e0acb899233e0d4ad516f51c","https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/f640aedc69c848d3d1be57f0300fc40033ff6423","https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5697","https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5698","https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3","https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/4f0a66bd6307bfe0e0acb899233e0d4ad516f51c","https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/f640aedc69c848d3d1be57f0300fc40033ff6423","https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5697","https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5698","https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3"]}
