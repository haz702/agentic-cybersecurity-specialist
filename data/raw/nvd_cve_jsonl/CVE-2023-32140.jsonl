{"id":"CVE-2023-32140","publishedDate":"2024-05-03T02:15:17.567","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"D-Link DAP-1360 webproc var:sys_Token Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DAP-1360 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling requests to the /cgi-bin/webproc endpoint. When parsing the var:sys_Token parameter, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.\n. Was ZDI-CAN-18418.","references":["https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10324","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-532/","https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10324","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-532/"]}
