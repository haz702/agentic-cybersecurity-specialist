{"id":"CVE-2025-24977","publishedDate":"2025-05-05T17:18:47.397","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"OpenCTI is an open cyber threat intelligence (CTI) platform. Prior to version 6.4.11 any user with the capability `manage customizations` can execute commands on the underlying infrastructure where OpenCTI is hosted and can access internal server side secrets by misusing the web-hooks. Since the malicious user gets a root shell inside a container this opens up the the infrastructure environment for further attacks and exposures. Version 6.4.11 fixes the issue.","references":["https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/security/advisories/GHSA-mf88-g2wq-p7qm"]}
