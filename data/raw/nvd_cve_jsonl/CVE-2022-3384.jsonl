{"id":"CVE-2022-3384","publishedDate":"2022-11-29T21:15:11.067","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 via the populate_dropdown_options function that accepts user supplied input and passes it through call_user_func(). This is restricted to non-parameter PHP functions like phpinfo(); since user supplied parameters are not passed through the function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges, to execute code on the server.","references":["https://github.com/H4de5-7/vulnerabilities/blob/main/CVE-2022-3383%20%26%26%20CVE-2022-3384.md","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2805393%40ultimate-member&new=2805393%40ultimate-member&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories-continued/#CVE-2022-3384","https://www.yuque.com/docs/share/8796eef9-ac4c-4339-96b4-6c21313ecf3e","https://github.com/H4de5-7/vulnerabilities/blob/main/CVE-2022-3383%20%26%26%20CVE-2022-3384.md","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2805393%40ultimate-member&new=2805393%40ultimate-member&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories-continued/#CVE-2022-3384","https://www.yuque.com/docs/share/8796eef9-ac4c-4339-96b4-6c21313ecf3e"]}
