{"id":"CVE-2021-39172","publishedDate":"2021-08-27T23:15:06.900","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Cachet is an open source status page system. Prior to version 2.5.1, authenticated users, regardless of their privileges (User or Admin), can exploit a new line injection in the configuration edition feature (e.g. mail settings) and gain arbitrary code execution on the server. This issue was addressed in version 2.5.1 by improving `UpdateConfigCommandHandler` and preventing the use of new lines characters in new configuration values. As a workaround, only allow trusted source IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard.","references":["https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/","https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/releases/tag/v2.5.1","https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxw-cfrh-jxq6","https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/","https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/releases/tag/v2.5.1","https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/security/advisories/GHSA-9jxw-cfrh-jxq6"]}
