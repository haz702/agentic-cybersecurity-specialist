{"id":"CVE-2022-21681","publishedDate":"2022-01-14T17:15:13.270","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.","references":["https://github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/8f806573a3f6c6b7a39b8cdb66ab5ebb8d55a5f5","https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-5v2h-r2cx-5xgj","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AIXDMC3CSHYW3YWVSQOXAWLUYQHAO5UX/","https://github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/8f806573a3f6c6b7a39b8cdb66ab5ebb8d55a5f5","https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-5v2h-r2cx-5xgj","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AIXDMC3CSHYW3YWVSQOXAWLUYQHAO5UX/"]}
