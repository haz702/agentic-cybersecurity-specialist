In affected versions `app/routes/v3/admin.controller.ts` did not correctly verify whether the user was an administrator (High Level) or moderator (Low Level) causing the request to continue processing. The response would be a 403 with ADMIN_ONLY, however, next() would call leading to any updates/changes in the route to process. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.49. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n","references":["https://github.com/PrivateUploader/PrivateUploader/commit/869657d61e3c7a518177106fe63ea483082b0d3e","https://github.com/PrivateUploader/PrivateUploader/security/advisories/GHSA-vhrw-2472-rrjx","https://github.com/PrivateUploader/PrivateUploader/commit/869657d61e3c7a518177106fe63ea483082b0d3e","https://github.com/PrivateUploader/PrivateUploader/security/advisories/GHSA-vhrw-2472-rrjx"]}
