{"id":"CVE-2022-46363","publishedDate":"2022-12-13T15:15:11.677","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A vulnerability in Apache CXF before versions 3.5.5 and 3.4.10 allows an attacker to perform a remote directory listing or code exfiltration. The vulnerability only applies when the\u00a0CXFServlet is configured with both the\u00a0static-resources-list and\u00a0redirect-query-check attributes. These attributes are not supposed to be used together, and so the vulnerability can only arise if the CXF service is misconfigured.\n\n","references":["https://lists.apache.org/thread/pdzo1qgyplf4y523tnnzrcm7hoco3l8c","https://lists.apache.org/thread/pdzo1qgyplf4y523tnnzrcm7hoco3l8c"]}
