{"id":"CVE-2023-40547","publishedDate":"2024-01-25T16:15:07.717","cvssV3":8.3,"description":"A remote code execution vulnerability was found in Shim. The Shim boot support trusts attacker-controlled values when parsing an HTTP response. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a specific malicious HTTP request, leading to a completely controlled out-of-bounds write primitive and complete system compromise. This flaw is only exploitable during the early boot phase, an attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-Middle or compromise the boot server to be able to exploit this vulnerability successfully.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1834","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1835","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1873","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1876","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1883","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1902","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1903","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1959","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2086","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-40547","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2234589","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/26/1","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1834","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1835","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1873","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1876","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1883","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1902","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1903","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1959","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2086","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-40547","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2234589","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00009.html"]}
