{"id":"CVE-2020-15223","publishedDate":"2020-09-24T17:15:13.210","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"In ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for Go) before version 0.34.0, the `TokenRevocationHandler` ignores errors coming from the storage. This can lead to unexpected 200 status codes indicating successful revocation while the token is still valid. Whether an attacker can use this for her advantage depends on the ability to trigger errors in the store. This is fixed in version 0.34.0","references":["https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/03dd55813f5521985f7dd64277b7ba0cf1441319","https://github.com/ory/fosite/security/advisories/GHSA-7mqr-2v3q-v2wm","https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009#section-2.2.1","https://github.com/ory/fosite/commit/03dd55813f5521985f7dd64277b7ba0cf1441319","https://github.com/ory/fosite/security/advisories/GHSA-7mqr-2v3q-v2wm","https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009#section-2.2.1"]}
