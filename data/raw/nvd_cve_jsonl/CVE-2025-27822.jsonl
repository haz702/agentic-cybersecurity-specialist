{"id":"CVE-2025-27822","publishedDate":"2025-03-07T22:15:37.927","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An issue was discovered in the Masquerade module before 1.x-1.0.1 for Backdrop CMS. It allows people to temporarily switch to another user account. The module provides a \"Masquerade as admin\" permission to restrict people (who can masquerade) from switching to an account with administrative privileges. This permission is not always honored and may allow non-administrative users to masquerade as an administrator. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the \"Masquerade as user\" permission.","references":["https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-contrib-2025-006"]}
