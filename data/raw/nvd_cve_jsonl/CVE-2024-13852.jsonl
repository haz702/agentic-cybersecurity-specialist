{"id":"CVE-2024-13852","publishedDate":"2025-02-18T05:15:19.423","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Option Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in version 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the plugin_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/option-editor/trunk/option-editor.php#L70","https://wordpress.org/plugins/option-editor/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/50adbe1d-9d79-4015-9e09-2166f97efc47?source=cve"]}
