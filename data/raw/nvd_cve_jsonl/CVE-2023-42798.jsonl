{"id":"CVE-2023-42798","publishedDate":"2023-09-22T16:15:09.753","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"AutomataCI is a template git repository equipped with a native built-in semi-autonomous CI tools. An issue in versions 1.4.1 and below can let a release job reset the git root repository to the first commit. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue. As a workaround, make sure the `PROJECT_PATH_RELEASE` (e.g. `releases/`) directory is manually and actually `git cloned` properly, making it a different git repostiory from the root git repository.","references":["https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/AutomataCI/issues/93","https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/AutomataCI/security/advisories/GHSA-6q23-vhhg-8h89","https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/AutomataCI/issues/93","https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/AutomataCI/security/advisories/GHSA-6q23-vhhg-8h89"]}
