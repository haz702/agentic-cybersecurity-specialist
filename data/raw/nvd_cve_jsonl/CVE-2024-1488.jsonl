{"id":"CVE-2024-1488","publishedDate":"2024-02-15T05:15:10.257","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"A vulnerability was found in Unbound due to incorrect default permissions, allowing any process outside the unbound group to modify the unbound runtime configuration. If a process can connect over localhost to port 8953, it can alter the configuration of unbound.service. This flaw allows an unprivileged attacker to manipulate a running instance, potentially altering forwarders, allowing them to track all queries forwarded by the local resolver, and, in some cases, disrupting resolving altogether.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1750","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1751","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1780","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1801","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1802","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1804","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2587","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2696","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0837","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-1488","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2264183","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1750","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1751","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1780","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1801","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1802","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1804","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2587","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2696","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-1488","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2264183"]}
