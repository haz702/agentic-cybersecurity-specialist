{"id":"CVE-2021-36219","publishedDate":"2021-09-27T14:15:08.537","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in SKALE sgxwallet 1.58.3. The provided input for ECALL 14 triggers a branch in trustedEcdsaSign that frees a non-initialized pointer from the stack. An attacker can chain multiple enclave calls to prepare a stack that contains a valid address. This address is then freed, resulting in compromised integrity of the enclave. This was resolved after v1.58.3 and not reproducible in sgxwallet v1.77.0.","references":["https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/commit/4e9b5b7526db083177e81f8bafeaa4914d276a82","https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/releases","https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/commit/4e9b5b7526db083177e81f8bafeaa4914d276a82","https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/releases"]}
