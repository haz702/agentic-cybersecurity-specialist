{"id":"CVE-2023-26557","publishedDate":"2023-04-21T18:15:07.990","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"io.finnet tss-lib before 2.0.0 can leak the lambda value of a private key via a timing side-channel attack because it relies on Go big.Int, which is not constant time for Cmp, modular exponentiation, or modular inverse. An example leak is in crypto/paillier/paillier.go. (bnb-chain/tss-lib and thorchain/tss are also affected.)","references":["https://github.com/IoFinnet/tss-lib/releases/tag/v2.0.0","https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib/tree/v1.3.5","https://gitlab.com/thorchain/tss/tss-lib/-/tags/v0.1.3","https://medium.com/%40iofinnet/security-disclosure-for-ecdsa-and-eddsa-threshold-signature-schemes-4e969af7155b","https://github.com/IoFinnet/tss-lib/releases/tag/v2.0.0","https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib/tree/v1.3.5","https://gitlab.com/thorchain/tss/tss-lib/-/tags/v0.1.3","https://medium.com/%40iofinnet/security-disclosure-for-ecdsa-and-eddsa-threshold-signature-schemes-4e969af7155b"]}
