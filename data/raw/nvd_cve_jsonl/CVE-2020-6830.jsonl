{"id":"CVE-2020-6830","publishedDate":"2020-05-26T18:15:11.450","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"For native-to-JS bridging, the app requires a unique token to be passed that ensures non-app code can't call the bridging functions. That token was being used for JS-to-native also, but it isn't needed in this case, and its usage was also leaking this token. This vulnerability affects Firefox for iOS < 25.","references":["https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1632387","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-15/","https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1632387","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-15/"]}
