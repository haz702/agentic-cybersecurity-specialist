This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'usernames' parameter.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wedevs-project-manager/tags/2.6.3/src/User/Controllers/User_Controller.php#L158","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2942291/wedevs-project-manager#file1792","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6a5e4708-db3e-483c-852f-1a487825cf92?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wedevs-project-manager/tags/2.6.3/src/User/Controllers/User_Controller.php#L158","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2942291/wedevs-project-manager#file1792","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6a5e4708-db3e-483c-852f-1a487825cf92?source=cve"]}
