The application sets up a simple local web server and provides APIs for communication with the target website. Due to the lack of CSRF protection in the APIs, unauthenticated remote attackers could use these APIs through phishing. Additionally, one of the APIs contains an Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability, allowing attackers to delete arbitrary files on the user's system.","references":["https://www.twcert.org.tw/en/cp-139-8304-b83f8-2.html","https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-8298-10b36-1.html"]}
