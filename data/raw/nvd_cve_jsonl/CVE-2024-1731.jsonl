{"id":"CVE-2024-1731","publishedDate":"2024-03-05T02:15:26.937","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Auto Refresh Single Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.1 via deserialization of untrusted input from the arsp_options post meta option. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/auto-refresh-single-page/trunk/auto-refresh-single-page.php#L42","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5f8f8d46-d7e7-4b07-9b10-15e579973474?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/auto-refresh-single-page/trunk/auto-refresh-single-page.php#L42","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5f8f8d46-d7e7-4b07-9b10-15e579973474?source=cve"]}
