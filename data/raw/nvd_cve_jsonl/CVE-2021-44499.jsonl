{"id":"CVE-2021-44499","publishedDate":"2022-04-15T18:15:09.077","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An issue was discovered in FIS GT.M through V7.0-000 (related to the YottaDB code base). Using crafted input, an attacker can cause a call to $Extract to force an signed integer holding the size of a buffer to take on a large negative number, which is then used as the length of a memcpy call that occurs on the stack, causing a buffer overflow.","references":["http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-002_Release_Notes.html","https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/828","https://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/","http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-002_Release_Notes.html","https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/828","https://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/"]}
