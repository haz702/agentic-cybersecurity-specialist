{"id":"CVE-2025-0182","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:50.910","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A vulnerability in danswer-ai/danswer version 0.9.0 allows for denial of service through memory exhaustion. The issue arises from the use of a vulnerable version of the starlette package (<=0.49) via fastapi, which was patched in fastapi version 0.115.3. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending multiple requests to the /auth/saml/callback endpoint, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventual denial of service.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/969b8056-b66c-4d70-8f77-04c1cbdc1d1a"]}
