{"id":"CVE-2021-4350","publishedDate":"2023-06-07T02:15:13.730","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated HTML Injection in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking authentication protections on the wpfm_send_file_in_email AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails using the site with a custom subject, recipient email, and body with unsanitized HTML content.  This effectively lets the attacker use the site as a spam relay.","references":["https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-frontend-file-manager-plugin-fixed-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/49150180-9de0-4318-b21b-779daaeb7a52?source=cve","https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-frontend-file-manager-plugin-fixed-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/49150180-9de0-4318-b21b-779daaeb7a52?source=cve"]}
