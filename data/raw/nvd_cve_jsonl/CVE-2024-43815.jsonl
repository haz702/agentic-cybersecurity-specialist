{"id":"CVE-2024-43815","publishedDate":"2024-08-17T10:15:07.870","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: mxs-dcp - Ensure payload is zero when using key slot\n\nWe could leak stack memory through the payload field when running\nAES with a key from one of the hardware's key slots. Fix this by\nensuring the payload field is set to 0 in such cases.\n\nThis does not affect the common use case when the key is supplied\nfrom main memory via the descriptor payload.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd52b5eeb0f70893f762da7254e923fd23fd1379","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1640fed0377bf7276efb70d03cb821a6931063d"]}
