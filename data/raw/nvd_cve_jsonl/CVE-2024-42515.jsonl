{"id":"CVE-2024-42515","publishedDate":"2024-10-31T19:15:12.983","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"Glossarizer through 1.5.2 improperly tries to convert text into HTML. Even though the application itself escapes special characters (e.g., <>), the underlying library converts these encoded characters into legitimate HTML, thereby possibly causing stored XSS. Attackers can append a XSS payload to a word that has a corresponding glossary entry.","references":["https://github.com/PebbleRoad/glossarizer","https://herolab.usd.de/security-advisories/usd-2024-0011/","https://www.npmjs.com/package/glossarizer"]}
