{"id":"CVE-2021-4037","publishedDate":"2022-08-24T16:15:09.257","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner() function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for the XFS.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4037","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004810","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2027239","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=01ea173e103e","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0fa3ecd87848","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00001.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5257","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4037","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004810","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2027239","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=01ea173e103e","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0fa3ecd87848","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00001.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5257"]}
