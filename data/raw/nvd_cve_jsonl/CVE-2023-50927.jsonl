{"id":"CVE-2023-50927","publishedDate":"2024-02-14T20:15:45.367","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for Next-Generation IoT devices. An attacker can trigger out-of-bounds reads in the RPL-Lite implementation of the RPL protocol in the Contiki-NG operating system. This vulnerability is caused by insufficient control of the lengths for DIO and DAO messages, in particular when they contain RPL sub-option headers. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.9. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should manually apply the code changes in PR #2484.","references":["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2484","https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-9423-rgj4-wjfw","https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2484","https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-9423-rgj4-wjfw"]}
