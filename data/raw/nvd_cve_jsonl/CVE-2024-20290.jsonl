{"id":"CVE-2024-20290","publishedDate":"2024-02-07T17:15:10.517","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A vulnerability in the OLE2 file format parser of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to an incorrect check for end-of-string values during scanning, which may result in a heap buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software and consuming available system resources.\r\n\r For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog .","references":["https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5FXZYVDNV66RNMNVJOHAJAYRZV4U64CQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6MUDUPAHAAV6FPB2C2QIQCFJ4SHYBOTY/","https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-clamav-hDffu6t","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5FXZYVDNV66RNMNVJOHAJAYRZV4U64CQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6MUDUPAHAAV6FPB2C2QIQCFJ4SHYBOTY/","https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-clamav-hDffu6t"]}
