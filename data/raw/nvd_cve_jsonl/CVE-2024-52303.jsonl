{"id":"CVE-2024-52303","publishedDate":"2024-11-18T20:15:06.047","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In versions starting with 3.10.6 and prior to 3.10.11, a memory leak can occur when a request produces a MatchInfoError. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each MatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares with aiohttp.web should upgrade to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.","references":["https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/bc15db61615079d1b6327ba42c682f758fa96936","https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-27mf-ghqm-j3j8"]}
