{"id":"CVE-2021-4093","publishedDate":"2022-02-18T18:15:10.363","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting the Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES). A KVM guest using SEV-ES can trigger out-of-bounds reads and writes in the host kernel via a malicious VMGEXIT for a string I/O instruction (for example, outs or ins) using the exit reason SVM_EXIT_IOIO. This issue results in a crash of the entire system or a potential guest-to-host escape scenario.","references":["https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2222","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028584","https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2222","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028584"]}
