{"id":"CVE-2023-38199","publishedDate":"2023-07-13T03:15:10.023","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"coreruleset (aka OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set) through 3.3.4 does not detect multiple Content-Type request headers on some platforms. This might allow attackers to bypass a WAF with a crafted payload, aka \"Content-Type confusion\" between the WAF and the backend application. This occurs when the web application relies on only the last Content-Type header. Other platforms may reject the additional Content-Type header or merge conflicting headers, leading to detection as a malformed header.","references":["https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3191","https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3237","https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3191","https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3237"]}
