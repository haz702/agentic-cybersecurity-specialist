{"id":"CVE-2024-12919","publishedDate":"2025-01-14T10:15:07.250","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Paid Membership Subscriptions \u2013 Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.13.7. This is due to the pms_pb_payment_redirect_link function using the user-controlled value supplied via the 'pms_payment_id' parameter to authenticate users without any further identity validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers with knowledge of a valid payment ID to log in as any user who has made a purchase on the targeted site.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3214706/paid-member-subscriptions","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d3a4fa4d-a7d2-4890-b0f5-5fe69bc5e7ac?source=cve"]}
