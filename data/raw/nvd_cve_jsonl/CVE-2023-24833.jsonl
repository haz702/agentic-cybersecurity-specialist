{"id":"CVE-2023-24833","publishedDate":"2023-05-18T22:15:09.700","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A use-after-free in BigIntPrimitive addition in Hermes prior to commit a6dcafe6ded8e61658b40f5699878cd19a481f80 could have been used by an attacker to leak raw data from Hermes VM\u2019s heap. Note that this is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.","references":["https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/a6dcafe6ded8e61658b40f5699878cd19a481f80","https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2023-24833","https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/a6dcafe6ded8e61658b40f5699878cd19a481f80","https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2023-24833"]}
