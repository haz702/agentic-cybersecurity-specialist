{"id":"CVE-2021-4362","publishedDate":"2023-06-07T02:15:14.420","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Kiwi Social Share plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the kiwi_social_share_get_option() function called via the kiwi_social_share_get_option AJAX action in version 2.1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read and modify arbitrary options on a WordPress site that can be used for complete site takeover. This was a previously fixed vulnerability that was reintroduced in this version.","references":["https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-kiwi-social-sharing-plugin-fixed-critical-vulnerability/","https://wordpress.org/plugins/kiwi-social-share/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8148b6d0-190a-4b97-8af7-edd6943116d1?source=cve","https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-kiwi-social-sharing-plugin-fixed-critical-vulnerability/","https://wordpress.org/plugins/kiwi-social-share/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8148b6d0-190a-4b97-8af7-edd6943116d1?source=cve"]}
