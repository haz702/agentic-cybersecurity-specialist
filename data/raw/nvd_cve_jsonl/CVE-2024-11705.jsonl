{"id":"CVE-2024-11705","publishedDate":"2024-11-26T14:15:19.997","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"`NSC_DeriveKey` inadvertently assumed that the `phKey` parameter is always non-NULL. When it was passed as NULL, a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurred, leading to crashes. This behavior conflicted with the PKCS#11 v3.0 specification, which allows `phKey` to be NULL for certain mechanisms. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 133 and Thunderbird < 133.","references":["https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1921768","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-63/","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-67/"]}
