{"id":"CVE-2020-13822","publishedDate":"2020-06-04T15:15:13.510","cvssV3":7.7,"description":"The Elliptic package 6.5.2 for Node.js allows ECDSA signature malleability via variations in encoding, leading '\\0' bytes, or integer overflows. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single canonical signature.","references":["https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/issues/226","https://medium.com/%40herman_10687/malleability-attack-why-it-matters-7b5f59fb99a4","https://www.npmjs.com/package/elliptic","https://yondon.blog/2019/01/01/how-not-to-use-ecdsa/","https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/issues/226","https://medium.com/%40herman_10687/malleability-attack-why-it-matters-7b5f59fb99a4","https://www.npmjs.com/package/elliptic","https://yondon.blog/2019/01/01/how-not-to-use-ecdsa/"]}
