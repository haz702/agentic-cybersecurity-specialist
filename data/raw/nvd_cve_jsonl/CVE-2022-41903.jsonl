{"id":"CVE-2022-41903","publishedDate":"2023-01-17T23:15:15.690","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Git is distributed revision control system. `git log` can display commits in an arbitrary format using its `--format` specifiers. This functionality is also exposed to `git archive` via the `export-subst` gitattribute. When processing the padding operators, there is a integer overflow in `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a `size_t` is stored improperly as an `int`, and then added as an offset to a `memcpy()`. This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g., `git log --format=...`). It may also be triggered indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes, which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to upgrade should disable `git archive` in untrusted repositories. If you expose git archive via `git daemon`, disable it by running `git config --global daemon.uploadArch false`.","references":["https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#_export_subst","https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats#Documentation/pretty-formats.txt-emltltNgttruncltruncmtruncem","https://github.com/git/git/commit/508386c6c5857b4faa2c3e491f422c98cc69ae76","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-475x-2q3q-hvwq","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15","https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#_export_subst","https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats#Documentation/pretty-formats.txt-emltltNgttruncltruncmtruncem","https://github.com/git/git/commit/508386c6c5857b4faa2c3e491f422c98cc69ae76","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-475x-2q3q-hvwq","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15"]}
