{"id":"CVE-2024-45261","publishedDate":"2024-10-24T21:15:12.057","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"An issue was discovered on certain GL-iNet devices, including MT6000, MT3000, MT2500, AXT1800, and AX1800 4.6.2. The SID generated for a specific user is not tied to that user itself, which allows other users to potentially use it for authentication. Once an attacker bypasses the application's authentication procedures, they can generate a valid SID, escalate privileges, and gain full control.","references":["https://github.com/gl-inet/CVE-issues/blob/main/4.0.0/Bypassing%20Login%20Mechanism%20with%20Passwordless%20User%20Login.md"]}
