{"id":"CVE-2021-29441","publishedDate":"2021-04-27T21:15:07.993","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"Nacos is a platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration and service management. In Nacos before version 1.4.1, when configured to use authentication (-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true) Nacos uses the AuthFilter servlet filter to enforce authentication. This filter has a backdoor that enables Nacos servers to bypass this filter and therefore skip authentication checks. This mechanism relies on the user-agent HTTP header so it can be easily spoofed. This issue may allow any user to carry out any administrative tasks on the Nacos server.","references":["https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36hp-jr8h-556f","https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/4701","https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/4703","https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36hp-jr8h-556f","https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/4701","https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/pull/4703"]}
