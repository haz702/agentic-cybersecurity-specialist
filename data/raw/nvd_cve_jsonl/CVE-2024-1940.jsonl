{"id":"CVE-2024-1940","publishedDate":"2024-06-05T06:15:09.780","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"The Brizy \u2013 Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via post content in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.41 due to insufficient input sanitization performed only on the client side and insufficient output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3055256%40brizy&new=3055256%40brizy&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e056dcb5-a66b-4cd3-9a73-37f226015e09?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3055256%40brizy&new=3055256%40brizy&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e056dcb5-a66b-4cd3-9a73-37f226015e09?source=cve"]}
