{"id":"CVE-2025-3418","publishedDate":"2025-04-12T07:15:27.277","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The WPC Admin Columns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions 2.0.6 to 2.1.0. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting user meta values that can be updated through the ajax_edit_save() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to that of an administrator.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3269302/wpc-admin-columns/trunk/includes/class-backend.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6145e2d7-c917-4814-a13e-6d34088cb784?source=cve"]}
