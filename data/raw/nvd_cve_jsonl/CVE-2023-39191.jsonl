{"id":"CVE-2023-39191","publishedDate":"2023-10-04T19:15:10.210","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"An improper input validation flaw was found in the eBPF subsystem in the Linux kernel. The issue occurs due to a lack of proper validation of dynamic pointers within user-supplied eBPF programs prior to executing them. This may allow an attacker with CAP_BPF privileges to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6583","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0381","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0439","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0448","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39191","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2226783","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-CAN-19399/","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6583","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0381","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0439","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0448","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-39191","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2226783","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-CAN-19399/"]}
