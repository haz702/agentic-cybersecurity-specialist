An attacker could provide a single byte to a UTF16 decoder instantiated with UseBOM or ExpectBOM to trigger an infinite loop if the String function on the Decoder is called, or the Decoder is passed to golang.org/x/text/transform.String.","references":["https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21topic/golang-announce/bXVeAmGOqz0","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TACQFZDPA7AUR6TRZBCX2RGRFSDYLI7O/","https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21topic/golang-announce/bXVeAmGOqz0","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TACQFZDPA7AUR6TRZBCX2RGRFSDYLI7O/"]}
