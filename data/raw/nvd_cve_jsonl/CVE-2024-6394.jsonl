{"id":"CVE-2024-6394","publishedDate":"2024-09-30T08:15:03.850","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A Local File Inclusion vulnerability exists in parisneo/lollms-webui versions below v9.8. The vulnerability is due to unverified path concatenation in the `serve_js` function in `app.py`, which allows attackers to perform path traversal attacks. This can lead to unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as private SSH keys, configuration files, and source code.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/6df4f990-b632-4791-b3ea-f40c9ea905bf"]}
