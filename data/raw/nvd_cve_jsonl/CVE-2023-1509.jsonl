{"id":"CVE-2023-1509","publishedDate":"2023-03-29T11:15:07.117","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The GMAce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.2. This is due to missing nonce validation on the gmace_manager_server function called via the wp_ajax_gmace_manager AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/gmace/trunk/gmace.php?rev=1583327#L84","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/gmace/trunk/inc/filemanager.php?rev=1583319#L27","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/826b3913-9a37-4e15-80fd-b35cefb51af8?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/gmace/trunk/gmace.php?rev=1583327#L84","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/gmace/trunk/inc/filemanager.php?rev=1583319#L27","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/826b3913-9a37-4e15-80fd-b35cefb51af8?source=cve"]}
