{"id":"CVE-2025-1306","publishedDate":"2025-03-04T05:15:13.590","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Newscrunch theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the newscrunch_install_and_activate_plugin() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/newscrunch/1.8.3/functions.php#L486","https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=261789%40newscrunch&new=261789%40newscrunch&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1c507681-61e9-4bf0-8fe5-e2f401a7a8be?source=cve"]}
