{"id":"CVE-2022-4696","publishedDate":"2023-01-11T13:15:09.307","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"There exists a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel through io_uring and the\u00a0IORING_OP_SPLICE operation. If\u00a0IORING_OP_SPLICE is\u00a0missing the IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag, which signals that the operation won't use current->nsproxy, so its reference counter is not increased. This assumption is not always true as calling io_splice on specific files will call the get_uts function which will use current->nsproxy leading to invalidly decreasing its reference counter later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading to version 5.10.160 or above\n","references":["https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?h=linux-5.10.y&id=75454b4bbfc7e6a4dd8338556f36ea9107ddf61a","https://kernel.dance/#75454b4bbfc7e6a4dd8338556f36ea9107ddf61a","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?h=linux-5.10.y&id=75454b4bbfc7e6a4dd8338556f36ea9107ddf61a","https://kernel.dance/#75454b4bbfc7e6a4dd8338556f36ea9107ddf61a","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230223-0003/"]}
