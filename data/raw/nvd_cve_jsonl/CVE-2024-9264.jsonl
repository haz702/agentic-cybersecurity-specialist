{"id":"CVE-2024-9264","publishedDate":"2024-10-18T04:15:04.723","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"The SQL Expressions experimental feature of Grafana allows for the evaluation of `duckdb` queries containing user input. These queries are insufficiently sanitized before being passed to `duckdb`, leading to a command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability. Any user with the VIEWER or higher permission is capable of executing this attack.  The `duckdb` binary must be present in Grafana's $PATH for this attack to function; by default, this binary is not installed in Grafana distributions.","references":["https://grafana.com/security/security-advisories/cve-2024-9264/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250314-0007/"]}
