{"id":"CVE-2024-21643","publishedDate":"2024-01-10T05:15:09.050","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"IdentityModel Extensions for .NET provide assemblies for web developers that wish to use federated identity providers for establishing the caller's identity. Anyone leveraging the `SignedHttpRequest`protocol or the `SignedHttpRequestValidator`is vulnerable. Microsoft.IdentityModel trusts the `jku`claim by default for the `SignedHttpRequest`protocol. This raises the possibility to make any remote or local `HTTP GET` request. The vulnerability has been fixed in Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.SignedHttpRequest. Users should update all their Microsoft.IdentityModel versions to 7.1.2 (for 7x) or higher, 6.34.0 (for 6x) or higher.","references":["https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/releases/tag/6.34.0","https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/releases/tag/7.1.2","https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/security/advisories/GHSA-rv9j-c866-gp5h","https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/wiki/jkucve","https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/releases/tag/6.34.0","https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/releases/tag/7.1.2","https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/security/advisories/GHSA-rv9j-c866-gp5h","https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/wiki/jkucve"]}
