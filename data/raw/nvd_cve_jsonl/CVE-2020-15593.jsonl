{"id":"CVE-2020-15593","publishedDate":"2020-07-27T14:15:12.460","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"SteelCentral Aternity Agent 11.0.0.120 on Windows mishandles IPC. It uses an executable running as a high privileged Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other processes. It distributes functionality among different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to enable the processes to cooperate. Any user in the system is allowed to access the interprocess communication channel AternityAgentAssistantIpc, retrieve a serialized object and call object methods remotely. Among others, the methods allow any user to: (1) Create and/or overwrite arbitrary XML files across the system; (2) Create arbitrary directories across the system; and (3) Load arbitrary plugins (i.e., C# assemblies) from the \"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins\u201d directory and execute code contained in them.","references":["https://aternity.force.com/customersuccess/s/article/Recorder-tool-security-notification-mitigation-steps-for-On-Prem","https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-steelcentral-aternity-agent-cve-2020-15592-cve-2020-15593/","https://aternity.force.com/customersuccess/s/article/Recorder-tool-security-notification-mitigation-steps-for-On-Prem","https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-steelcentral-aternity-agent-cve-2020-15592-cve-2020-15593/"]}
