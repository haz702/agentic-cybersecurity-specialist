{"id":"CVE-2022-1247","publishedDate":"2022-08-31T16:15:09.177","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"An issue found in linux-kernel that leads to a race condition in rose_connect(). The rose driver uses rose_neigh->use to represent how many objects are using the rose_neigh. When a user wants to delete a rose_route via rose_ioctl(), the rose driver calls rose_del_node() and removes neighbours only if their \u201ccount\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d are zero.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1247","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2066799","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1247","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2066799"]}
