{"id":"CVE-2022-2541","publishedDate":"2022-09-06T18:15:14.377","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The uContext for Amazon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 3.9.1. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/app/sites/ajax/actions/keyword_save.php file that is called via the doAjax() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ucontext-for-amazon/trunk/app/Ucontext4a_Ajax.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ucontext-for-amazon/trunk/app/sites/ajax/actions/keyword_save.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0f7c43d4-cf21-4324-bc77-50bdc2c24661?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2541","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ucontext-for-amazon/trunk/app/Ucontext4a_Ajax.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ucontext-for-amazon/trunk/app/sites/ajax/actions/keyword_save.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0f7c43d4-cf21-4324-bc77-50bdc2c24661?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2541"]}
