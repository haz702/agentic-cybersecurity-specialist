This is arguably a Principle of Least Surprise violation because \"the user likely wanted to encrypt all file activity.\"","references":["https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/commit/cadf598e1c2a345915a21a44518c5a4d5401e2e3","https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/pull/1062","https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/commit/cadf598e1c2a345915a21a44518c5a4d5401e2e3","https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/pull/1062"]}
