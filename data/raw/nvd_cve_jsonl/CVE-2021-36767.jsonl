{"id":"CVE-2021-36767","publishedDate":"2021-10-08T15:15:09.037","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"In Digi RealPort through 4.10.490, authentication relies on a challenge-response mechanism that gives access to the server password, making the protection ineffective. An attacker may send an unauthenticated request to the server. The server will reply with a weakly-hashed version of the server's access password. The attacker may then crack this hash offline in order to successfully login to the server.","references":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reidmefirst/vuln-disclosure/main/2021-02.txt","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reidmefirst/vuln-disclosure/main/2021-02.txt"]}
