{"id":"CVE-2024-5148","publishedDate":"2024-09-02T12:15:19.910","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A flaw was found in the gnome-remote-desktop package. The gnome-remote-desktop system daemon performs inadequate validation of session agents using D-Bus methods related to transitioning a client connection from the login screen to the user session. As a result, the system RDP TLS certificate and key can be exposed to unauthorized users. This flaw allows a malicious user on the system to take control of the RDP client connection during the login screen-to-user session transition.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-5148","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2282003","https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-remote-desktop/-/issues/196"]}
