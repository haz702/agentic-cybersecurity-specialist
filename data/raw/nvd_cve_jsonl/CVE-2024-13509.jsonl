This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability is partially fixed in 1.10.13 and completely fixed in 1.10.14.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3225862/ws-form","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3226595/ws-form","https://wsform.com/changelog/?utm_source=wp_plugins&utm_medium=readme","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/910d9b31-b63a-427e-830b-a4c6a7e77ade?source=cve"]}
