{"id":"CVE-2022-25152","publishedDate":"2022-06-09T17:15:08.847","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"The ITarian platform (SAAS / on-premise) offers the possibility to run code on agents via a function called procedures. It is possible to require a mandatory approval process. Due to a vulnerability in the approval process, present in any version prior to 6.35.37347.20040, a malicious actor (with a valid session token) can create a procedure, bypass approval, and execute the procedure. This results in the ability for any user with a valid session token to perform arbitrary code execution and full system take-over on all agents.","references":["https://csirt.divd.nl/CVE-2022-25152","https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2021-00037","https://csirt.divd.nl/CVE-2022-25152","https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2021-00037"]}
