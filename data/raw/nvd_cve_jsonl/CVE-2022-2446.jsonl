{"id":"CVE-2022-2446","publishedDate":"2024-09-13T15:15:13.577","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The WP Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'current_theme_root' parameter in versions up to, and including 1.2.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3151053/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f3555702-4427-4569-8fd6-f84113593e9d?source=cve"]}
