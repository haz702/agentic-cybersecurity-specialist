{"id":"CVE-2024-29900","publishedDate":"2024-03-29T16:15:08.103","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Electron Packager bundles Electron-based application source code with a renamed Electron executable and supporting files into folders ready for distribution. A random segment of ~1-10kb of Node.js heap memory allocated either side of a known buffer will be leaked into the final executable. This memory _could_ contain sensitive information such as environment variables, secrets files, etc. This issue is patched in 18.3.1.\n","references":["https://github.com/electron/packager/commit/d421d4bd3ced889a4143c5c3ab6d95e3be249eee","https://github.com/electron/packager/security/advisories/GHSA-34h3-8mw4-qw57","https://github.com/electron/packager/commit/d421d4bd3ced889a4143c5c3ab6d95e3be249eee","https://github.com/electron/packager/security/advisories/GHSA-34h3-8mw4-qw57"]}
