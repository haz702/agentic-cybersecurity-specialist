{"id":"CVE-2024-8676","publishedDate":"2024-11-26T20:15:34.260","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"A vulnerability was found in CRI-O, where it can be requested to take a checkpoint archive of a container and later be asked to restore it. When it does that restoration, it attempts to restore the mounts from the restore archive instead of the pod request. As a result, the validations run on the pod spec, verifying that the pod has access to the mounts it specifies are not applicable to a restored container. This flaw allows a malicious user to trick CRI-O into restoring a pod that doesn't have access to host mounts. The user needs access to the kubelet or cri-o socket to call the restore endpoint and trigger the restore.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2024:10826","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0648","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:1908","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:3297","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:4211","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-8676","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2313842"]}
