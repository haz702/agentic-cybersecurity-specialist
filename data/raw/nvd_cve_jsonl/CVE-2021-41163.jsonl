{"id":"CVE-2021-41163","publishedDate":"2021-10-20T23:15:07.477","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions maliciously crafted requests could lead to remote code execution. This resulted from a lack of validation in subscribe_url values. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. To workaround the issue without updating, requests with a path starting /webhooks/aws path could be blocked at an upstream proxy.","references":["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/fa3c46cf079d28b086fe1025349bb00223a5d5e9","https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-jcjx-pvpc-qgwq","https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/fa3c46cf079d28b086fe1025349bb00223a5d5e9","https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-jcjx-pvpc-qgwq"]}
