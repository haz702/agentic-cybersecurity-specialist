{"id":"CVE-2023-6779","publishedDate":"2024-01-31T14:15:48.700","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"An off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when these functions are called with a message bigger than INT_MAX bytes, leading to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size to store the message, resulting in an application crash. This issue affects glibc 2.37 and newer.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176932/glibc-syslog-Heap-Based-Buffer-Overflow.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Feb/3","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6779","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254395","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D2FIH77VHY3KCRROCXOT6L27WMZXSJ2G/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MWQ6BZJ6CV5UAW4VZSKJ6TO4KIW2KWAQ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240223-0006/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/30/6","https://www.qualys.com/2024/01/30/cve-2023-6246/syslog.txt","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176932/glibc-syslog-Heap-Based-Buffer-Overflow.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Feb/3","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6779","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254395","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D2FIH77VHY3KCRROCXOT6L27WMZXSJ2G/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MWQ6BZJ6CV5UAW4VZSKJ6TO4KIW2KWAQ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240223-0006/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/30/6","https://www.qualys.com/2024/01/30/cve-2023-6246/syslog.txt"]}
