{"id":"CVE-2022-48337","publishedDate":"2023-02-20T23:15:12.243","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell metacharacters in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c uses the system C library function in its implementation of the etags program. For example, a victim may use the \"etags -u *\" command (suggested in the etags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory has contents that depend on untrusted input.","references":["https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=01a4035c869b91c153af9a9132c87adb7669ea1c","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00008.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FLPQ4K6H2S5TY3L5UDN4K4B3L5RQJYQ6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U6HDBUQNAH2WL4MHWCTUZLN7NGF7CHTK/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5360","https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=01a4035c869b91c153af9a9132c87adb7669ea1c","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00008.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FLPQ4K6H2S5TY3L5UDN4K4B3L5RQJYQ6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U6HDBUQNAH2WL4MHWCTUZLN7NGF7CHTK/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5360"]}
