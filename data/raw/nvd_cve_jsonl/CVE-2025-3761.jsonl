This is due to the mt_save_profile() function not appropriately restricting access to unauthorized users to update roles. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to that of an administrator.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3280248/my-tickets/trunk/my-tickets.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6d875c23-3d8a-4f82-bea3-1c46b5045d94?source=cve"]}
