{"id":"CVE-2025-21993","publishedDate":"2025-04-02T13:15:43.940","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niscsi_ibft: Fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning in ibft_attr_show_nic()\n\nWhen performing an iSCSI boot using IPv6, iscsistart still reads the\n/sys/firmware/ibft/ethernetX/subnet-mask entry. Since the IPv6 prefix\nlength is 64, this causes the shift exponent to become negative,\ntriggering a UBSAN warning. As the concept of a subnet mask does not\napply to IPv6, the value is set to ~0 to suppress the warning message.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/07e0d99a2f701123ad3104c0f1a1e66bce74d6e5","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2d1eef248107bdf3d5a69d0fde04c30a79a7bf5d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9bfa80c8aa4e06dff55a953c3fffbfc68a3a3b1c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a858cd58dea06cf85b142673deea8c5d87f11e70","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b253660fac5e0e9080d2c95e3a029e1898d49afb","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b388e185bfad32bfed6a97a6817f74ca00a4318f","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c1c6e527470e5eab0b2d57bd073530fbace39eab","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f763c82db8166e28f45b7cc4a5398a7859665940"]}
