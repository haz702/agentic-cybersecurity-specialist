{"id":"CVE-2023-29403","publishedDate":"2023-06-08T21:15:16.927","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"On Unix platforms, the Go runtime does not behave differently when a binary is run with the setuid/setgid bits. This can be dangerous in certain cases, such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file descriptors. If a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files can result in unexpected content being read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.","references":["https://go.dev/cl/501223","https://go.dev/issue/60272","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NZ2O6YCO2IZMZJELQGZYR2WAUNEDLYV6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XBS3IIK6ADV24C5ULQU55QLT2UE762ZX/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1840","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/501223","https://go.dev/issue/60272","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NZ2O6YCO2IZMZJELQGZYR2WAUNEDLYV6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XBS3IIK6ADV24C5ULQU55QLT2UE762ZX/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1840","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241220-0009/"]}
