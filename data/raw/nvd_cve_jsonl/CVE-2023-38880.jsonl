{"id":"CVE-2023-38880","publishedDate":"2023-11-20T19:15:08.600","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Community Edition version 9.0 of OS4ED's openSIS Classic has a broken access control vulnerability in the database backup functionality. Whenever an admin generates a database backup, the backup is stored in the web root while the file name has a format of \"opensisBackup<date>.sql\" (e.g. \"opensisBackup07-20-2023.sql\"), i.e. can easily be guessed. This file can be accessed by any unauthenticated actor and contains a dump of the whole database including password hashes.","references":["https://github.com/OS4ED/openSIS-Classic","https://github.com/dub-flow/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2023-38880","https://www.os4ed.com/","https://github.com/OS4ED/openSIS-Classic","https://github.com/dub-flow/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2023-38880","https://www.os4ed.com/"]}
