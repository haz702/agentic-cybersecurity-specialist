{"id":"CVE-2024-47879","publishedDate":"2024-10-24T21:15:12.523","cvssV3":7.6,"description":"OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, lack of cross-site request forgery protection on the `preview-expression` command means that visiting a malicious website could cause an attacker-controlled expression to be executed. The expression can contain arbitrary Clojure or Python code. The attacker must know a valid project ID of a project that contains at least one row, and the attacker must convince the victim to open a malicious webpage. Version 3.8.3 fixes the issue.","references":["https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/090924ca923489b6c94397cf1f5df7f7f78f0126","https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-3jm4-c6qf-jrh3"]}
