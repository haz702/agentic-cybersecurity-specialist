{"id":"CVE-2023-6270","publishedDate":"2024-01-04T17:15:08.803","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq` global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or potential code execution.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6270","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2256786","https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/block/aoe?h=v6.9&id=f98364e926626c678fb4b9004b75cacf92ff0662","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6270","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2256786","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00017.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00020.html"]}
