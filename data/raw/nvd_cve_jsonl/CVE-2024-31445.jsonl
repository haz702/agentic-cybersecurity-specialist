Prior to version 1.2.27, a SQL injection vulnerability in `automation_get_new_graphs_sql` function of `api_automation.php` allows authenticated users to exploit these SQL injection vulnerabilities to perform privilege escalation and remote code execution. In `api_automation.php` line 856, the `get_request_var('filter')` is being concatenated into the SQL statement without any sanitization. In `api_automation.php` line 717, The filter of `'filter'` is `FILTER_DEFAULT`, which means there is no filter for it. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.","references":["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/501712998589763d411a68d35e3cda98fd9cfd18/lib/api_automation.php#L717","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/501712998589763d411a68d35e3cda98fd9cfd18/lib/api_automation.php#L856","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/commit/fd93c6e47651958b77c3bbe6a01fff695f81e886","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-vjph-r677-6pcc","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RBEOAFKRARQHTDIYSL723XAFJ2Q6624X/","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/501712998589763d411a68d35e3cda98fd9cfd18/lib/api_automation.php#L717","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/501712998589763d411a68d35e3cda98fd9cfd18/lib/api_automation.php#L856","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/commit/fd93c6e47651958b77c3bbe6a01fff695f81e886","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-vjph-r677-6pcc","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RBEOAFKRARQHTDIYSL723XAFJ2Q6624X/"]}
