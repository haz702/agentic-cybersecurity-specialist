{"id":"CVE-2023-41105","publishedDate":"2023-08-23T07:15:08.590","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An issue was discovered in Python 3.11 through 3.11.4. If a path containing '\\0' bytes is passed to os.path.normpath(), the path will be truncated unexpectedly at the first '\\0' byte. There are plausible cases in which an application would have rejected a filename for security reasons in Python 3.10.x or earlier, but that filename is no longer rejected in Python 3.11.x.","references":["https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106242","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/107981","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/107982","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/107983","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/D6CDW3ZZC5D444YGL3VQUY6D4ECMCQLD/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0015/","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/106242","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/107981","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/107982","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/107983","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce%40python.org/thread/D6CDW3ZZC5D444YGL3VQUY6D4ECMCQLD/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231006-0015/"]}
