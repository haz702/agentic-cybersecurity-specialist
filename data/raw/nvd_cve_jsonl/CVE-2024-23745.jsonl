{"id":"CVE-2024-23745","publishedDate":"2024-01-31T02:15:54.520","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"In Notion Web Clipper 1.0.3(7), a .nib file is susceptible to the Dirty NIB attack. NIB files can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands. Additionally, even if a NIB file is modified within an application, Gatekeeper may still permit the execution of the application, enabling the execution of arbitrary commands within the application's context. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that this is simply an instance of CVE-2022-48505, cannot properly be categorized as a product-level vulnerability, and cannot have a product-level fix because it is about incorrect caching of file signatures on macOS.","references":["https://blog.xpnsec.com/dirtynib/","https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/faq.md#Why-arent-physically_local-attacks-in-Chromes-threat-model","https://github.com/louiselalanne/CVE-2024-23745","https://blog.xpnsec.com/dirtynib/","https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/faq.md#Why-arent-physically_local-attacks-in-Chromes-threat-model","https://github.com/louiselalanne/CVE-2024-23745"]}
