{"id":"CVE-2023-40548","publishedDate":"2024-01-29T15:15:08.893","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"A buffer overflow was found in Shim in the 32-bit system. The overflow happens due to an addition operation involving a user-controlled value parsed from the PE binary being used by Shim. This value is further used for memory allocation operations, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This flaw causes memory corruption and can lead to a crash or data integrity issues during the boot phase.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1834","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1835","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1873","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1876","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1883","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1902","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1903","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1959","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2086","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-40548","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2241782","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1834","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1835","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1873","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1876","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1883","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1902","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1903","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1959","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2086","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-40548","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2241782","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00009.html"]}
