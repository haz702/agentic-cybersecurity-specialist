{"id":"CVE-2023-36824","publishedDate":"2023-07-11T17:15:13.223","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. In Redit 7.0 prior to 7.0.12, extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. Several scenarios that may lead to authenticated users executing a specially crafted `COMMAND GETKEYS` or `COMMAND GETKEYSANDFLAGS`and authenticated users who were set with ACL rules that match key names, executing a specially crafted command that refers to a variadic list of key names. The vulnerability is patched in Redis 7.0.12.","references":["https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.0.12","https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-4cfx-h9gq-xpx3","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MIF5MAGYARYUMRFK7PQI7HYXMK2HZE5T/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TDNNH2ONMVNBQ6LUIAOAGDNFPKXNST5K/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230814-0009/","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.0.12","https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-4cfx-h9gq-xpx3","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MIF5MAGYARYUMRFK7PQI7HYXMK2HZE5T/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TDNNH2ONMVNBQ6LUIAOAGDNFPKXNST5K/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230814-0009/"]}
