{"id":"CVE-2024-6587","publishedDate":"2024-09-13T16:15:04.637","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in berriai/litellm version 1.38.10. This vulnerability allows users to specify the `api_base` parameter when making requests to `POST /chat/completions`, causing the application to send the request to the domain specified by `api_base`. This request includes the OpenAI API key. A malicious user can set the `api_base` to their own domain and intercept the OpenAI API key, leading to unauthorized access and potential misuse of the API key.","references":["https://github.com/berriai/litellm/commit/ba1912afd1b19e38d3704bb156adf887f91ae1e0","https://huntr.com/bounties/4001e1a2-7b7a-4776-a3ae-e6692ec3d997"]}
