{"id":"CVE-2024-45409","publishedDate":"2024-09-10T19:15:22.030","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"The Ruby SAML library is for implementing the client side of a SAML authorization. Ruby-SAML in <= 12.2 and 1.13.0 <= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of the SAML Response. An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed saml document (by the IdP) can thus forge a SAML Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. This would allow the attacker to log in as arbitrary user within the vulnerable system. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.17.0 and 1.12.3.","references":["https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/1ec5392bc506fe43a02dbb66b68741051c5ffeae","https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/commit/4865d030cae9705ee5cdb12415c654c634093ae7","https://github.com/SAML-Toolkits/ruby-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-jw9c-mfg7-9rx2","https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-saml/security/advisories/GHSA-cvp8-5r8g-fhvq","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00006.html","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41586031","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240926-0008/","https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/ruby-saml-pwned-by-xml-signature-wrapping-attacks/"]}
