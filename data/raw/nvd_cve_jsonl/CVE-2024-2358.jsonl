{"id":"CVE-2024-2358","publishedDate":"2024-05-16T09:15:09.800","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A path traversal vulnerability in the '/apply_settings' endpoint of parisneo/lollms-webui allows attackers to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the configuration settings, specifically within the 'extensions' parameter. Attackers can exploit this by crafting a payload that includes relative path traversal sequences ('../../../'), enabling them to navigate to arbitrary directories. This flaw subsequently allows the server to load and execute a malicious '__init__.py' file, leading to remote code execution. The issue affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/b2771df3-be50-45bd-93c4-0974ce38bc22","https://huntr.com/bounties/b2771df3-be50-45bd-93c4-0974ce38bc22"]}
