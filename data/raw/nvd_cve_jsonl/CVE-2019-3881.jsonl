{"id":"CVE-2019-3881","publishedDate":"2020-09-04T12:15:10.387","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Bundler prior to 2.1.0 uses a predictable path in /tmp/, created with insecure permissions as a storage location for gems, if locations under the user's home directory are not available. If Bundler is used in a scenario where the user does not have a writable home directory, an attacker could place malicious code in this directory that would be later loaded and executed.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1651826","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1651826"]}
