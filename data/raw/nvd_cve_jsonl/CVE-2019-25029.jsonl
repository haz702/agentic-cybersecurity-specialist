{"id":"CVE-2019-25029","publishedDate":"2021-05-26T19:15:08.773","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"In Versa Director, the command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.","references":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1168198","https://hackerone.com/reports/1168198"]}
