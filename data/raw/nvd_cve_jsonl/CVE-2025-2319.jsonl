{"id":"CVE-2025-2319","publishedDate":"2025-03-25T09:15:16.377","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The EZ SQL Reports Shortcode Widget and DB Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions 4.11.13 to 5.25.08. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'ELISQLREPORTS_menu' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Version 5.25.10 adds a nonce check, which makes this vulnerability exploitable by admins only.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/elisqlreports/tags/4..11.13/index.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/elisqlreports/tags/4..11.15/index.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/elisqlreports/tags/4..11.33/index.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/elisqlreports/tags/4.11.37/index.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/elisqlreports/tags/4.16.38/index.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/elisqlreports/tags/4.17.38/index.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/elisqlreports/tags/4.17.42/index.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/elisqlreports/tags/5.21.35/index.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/elisqlreports/tags/5.25.08/index.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eade6ab0-ff79-4107-83ce-e85b37d97442?source=cve"]}
