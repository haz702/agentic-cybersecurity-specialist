{"id":"CVE-2024-37298","publishedDate":"2024-07-01T19:15:04.283","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"gorilla/schema converts structs to and from form values. Prior to version 1.4.1 Running `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct that has a field of type `[]struct{...}` opens it up to malicious attacks regarding memory allocations, taking advantage of the sparse slice functionality. Any use of `schema.Decoder.Decode()` on a struct with arrays of other structs could be vulnerable to this memory exhaustion vulnerability. Version 1.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.","references":["https://github.com/gorilla/schema/blob/main/decoder.go#L223","https://github.com/gorilla/schema/commit/cd59f2f12cbdfa9c06aa63e425d1fe4a806967ff","https://github.com/gorilla/schema/security/advisories/GHSA-3669-72x9-r9p3","https://github.com/gorilla/schema/blob/main/decoder.go#L223","https://github.com/gorilla/schema/commit/cd59f2f12cbdfa9c06aa63e425d1fe4a806967ff","https://github.com/gorilla/schema/security/advisories/GHSA-3669-72x9-r9p3"]}
