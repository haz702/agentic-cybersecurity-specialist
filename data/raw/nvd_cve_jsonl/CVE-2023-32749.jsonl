By modifying the HTTP request sent when creating such an external user, it is possible to assign the new user arbitrary roles. By assigning all roles to a newly created user, access to all cells and non-personal workspaces is granted.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172645/Pydio-Cells-4.1.2-Privilege-Escalation.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/May/18","https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/-advisories-publicised-vulnerability-analyses","https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2023-003/-pydio-cells-unauthorised-role-assignments","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172645/Pydio-Cells-4.1.2-Privilege-Escalation.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/May/18","https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/-advisories-publicised-vulnerability-analyses","https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2023-003/-pydio-cells-unauthorised-role-assignments"]}
