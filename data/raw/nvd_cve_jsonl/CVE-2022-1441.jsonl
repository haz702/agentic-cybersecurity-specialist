{"id":"CVE-2022-1441","publishedDate":"2022-04-25T17:15:36.547","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"MP4Box is a component of GPAC-2.0.0, which is a widely-used third-party package on RPM Fusion. When MP4Box tries to parse a MP4 file, it calls the function `diST_box_read()` to read from video. In this function, it allocates a buffer `str` with fixed length. However, content read from `bs` is controllable by user, so is the length, which causes a buffer overflow.","references":["https://github.com/gpac/gpac/commit/3dbe11b37d65c8472faf0654410068e5500b3adb","https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/2175","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5411","https://github.com/gpac/gpac/commit/3dbe11b37d65c8472faf0654410068e5500b3adb","https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/2175","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5411"]}
