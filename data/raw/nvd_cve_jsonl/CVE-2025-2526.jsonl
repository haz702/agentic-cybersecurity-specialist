{"id":"CVE-2025-2526","publishedDate":"2025-04-08T02:15:20.523","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email in the 'st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.","references":["https://documentation.iqonic.design/streamit/change-log/streamit-v4-0/","https://themeforest.net/item/streamit-video-streaming-wordpress-theme/29772881","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/057abffb-1c52-49ca-8791-ca44f0c5a011?source=cve"]}
