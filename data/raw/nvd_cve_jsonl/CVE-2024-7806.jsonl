{"id":"CVE-2024-7806","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:37.893","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A vulnerability in open-webui/open-webui versions <= 0.3.8 allows remote code execution by non-admin users via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application uses cookies with the SameSite attribute set to lax for authentication and lacks CSRF tokens. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious HTML that, when accessed by a victim, can modify the Python code of an existing pipeline and execute arbitrary code with the victim's privileges.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/9350a68d-5f33-4b3d-988b-81e778160ab8","https://huntr.com/bounties/9350a68d-5f33-4b3d-988b-81e778160ab8"]}
