{"id":"CVE-2024-8361","publishedDate":"2025-01-07T17:15:31.420","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In SiWx91x devices, the SHA2/224 algorithm returns a hash of 256 bits instead of 224 bits. This incorrect hash length triggers a software assertion, which subsequently causes a Denial of Service (DoS).\nIf a watchdog is implemented, device will restart after watch dog expires. If watchdog is not implemented, device can be recovered only after a hard reset","references":["https://community.silabs.com/068Vm00000I7zqo"]}
