{"id":"CVE-2024-3954","publishedDate":"2024-05-14T15:42:37.727","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Ditty plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to 3.1.38 via deserialization of untrusted input when adding a new ditty. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3081335%40ditty-news-ticker&new=3081335%40ditty-news-ticker&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0f00b138-5c4b-4f75-94b1-82721cba2668?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3081335%40ditty-news-ticker&new=3081335%40ditty-news-ticker&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0f00b138-5c4b-4f75-94b1-82721cba2668?source=cve"]}
