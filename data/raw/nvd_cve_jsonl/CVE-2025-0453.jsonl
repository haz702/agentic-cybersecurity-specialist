{"id":"CVE-2025-0453","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:53.017","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In mlflow/mlflow version 2.17.2, the `/graphql` endpoint is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. An attacker can create large batches of queries that repeatedly request all runs from a given experiment. This can tie up all the workers allocated by MLFlow, rendering the application unable to respond to other requests. This vulnerability is due to uncontrolled resource consumption.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/788327ec-714a-4d5c-83aa-8df04dd7612b","https://huntr.com/bounties/788327ec-714a-4d5c-83aa-8df04dd7612b"]}
