{"id":"CVE-2023-36815","publishedDate":"2023-07-03T18:15:09.653","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"Sealos is a Cloud Operating System designed for managing cloud-native applications. In version 4.2.0 and prior, there is a permission flaw in the Sealos billing system, which allows users to control the recharge resource account `sealos[.] io/v1/Payment`, resulting in the ability to recharge any amount of 1 renminbi (RMB). The charging interface may expose resource information. The namespace of this custom resource would be user's control and may have permission to correct it. It is not clear whether a fix exists.","references":["https://github.com/labring/sealos/security/advisories/GHSA-vpxf-q44g-w34w","https://github.com/labring/sealos/security/advisories/GHSA-vpxf-q44g-w34w"]}
