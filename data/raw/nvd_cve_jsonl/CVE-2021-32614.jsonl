{"id":"CVE-2021-32614","publishedDate":"2021-05-26T22:15:08.193","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"A flaw was found in dmg2img through 20170502. fill_mishblk() does not check the length of the read buffer, and copy 0xCC bytes from it. The length of the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound. This possibly leads to memory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in a chain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1959911","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1959911"]}
