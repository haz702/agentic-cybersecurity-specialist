{"id":"CVE-2021-46743","publishedDate":"2022-03-29T07:15:07.017","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"In Firebase PHP-JWT before 6.0.0, an algorithm-confusion issue (e.g., RS256 / HS256) exists via the kid (aka Key ID) header, when multiple types of keys are loaded in a key ring. This allows an attacker to forge tokens that validate under the incorrect key. NOTE: this provides a straightforward way to use the PHP-JWT library unsafely, but might not be considered a vulnerability in the library itself.","references":["https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt/issues/351","https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt/issues/351"]}
