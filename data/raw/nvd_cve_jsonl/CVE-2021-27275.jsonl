{"id":"CVE-2021-27275","publishedDate":"2021-03-29T21:15:13.267","cvssV3":8.3,"description":"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information and delete arbitrary files on affected installations of NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System 1.6.0.26. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the ConfigFileController class. When parsing the realName parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information or to create a denial-of-service condition on the system.
