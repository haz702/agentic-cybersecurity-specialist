{"id":"CVE-2024-57801","publishedDate":"2025-01-15T13:15:11.713","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: Skip restore TC rules for vport rep without loaded flag\n\nDuring driver unload, unregister_netdev is called after unloading\nvport rep. So, the mlx5e_rep_priv is already freed while trying to get\nrpriv->netdev, or walk rpriv->tc_ht, which results in use-after-free.\nSo add the checking to make sure access the data of vport rep which is\nstill loaded.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3e45dd1622a2c1a83c11bf42fdd8c1810123d6c0","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/47c78d3fc26e38ab805613a0f592dc8a820c7c64","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5a03b368562a7ff5f5f1f63b5adf8309cbdbd5be"]}
