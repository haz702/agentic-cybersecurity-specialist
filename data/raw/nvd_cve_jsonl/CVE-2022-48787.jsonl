{"id":"CVE-2022-48787","publishedDate":"2024-07-16T12:15:03.633","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niwlwifi: fix use-after-free\n\nIf no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of the\nfirmware files failed to parse), we end up unbinding by calling\ndevice_release_driver(), which calls remove(), which then in\niwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the 'drv' struct. However\nthe new code I added will still erroneously access it after it\nwas freed.\n\nSet 'failure=false' in this case to avoid the access, all data\nwas already freed anyway.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/008508c16af0087cda0394e1ac6f0493b01b6063","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/494de920d98f125b099f27a2d274850750aff957","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7d6475179b85a83186ccce59cdc359d4f07d0bcb","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9958b9cbb22145295ee1ffaea0904c383da2c05d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bea2662e7818e15d7607d17d57912ac984275d94","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d3b98fe36f8a06ce654049540773256ab59cb53d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ddd46059f7d99119b62d44c519df7a79f2e6a515","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/008508c16af0087cda0394e1ac6f0493b01b6063","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/494de920d98f125b099f27a2d274850750aff957","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7d6475179b85a83186ccce59cdc359d4f07d0bcb","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9958b9cbb22145295ee1ffaea0904c383da2c05d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bea2662e7818e15d7607d17d57912ac984275d94","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d3b98fe36f8a06ce654049540773256ab59cb53d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ddd46059f7d99119b62d44c519df7a79f2e6a515"]}
