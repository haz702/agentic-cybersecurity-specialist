{"id":"CVE-2024-11024","publishedDate":"2024-11-26T11:21:58.660","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The AppPresser \u2013 Mobile App Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.6. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's password reset code prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, with knowledge of a user's email address, to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3192531/apppresser","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/43cb0399-4add-43d5-863c-30e11803bd90?source=cve"]}
