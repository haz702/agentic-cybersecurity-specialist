{"id":"CVE-2022-23512","publishedDate":"2022-12-14T14:15:10.370","cvssV3":7.7,"description":"MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform. Versions prior to 2.4.1 are vulnerable to Path Injection in ApiTestCaseService::deleteBodyFiles which takes a user-controlled string id and passes it to ApiTestCaseService, which uses the user-provided value (testId) in new File(BODY_FILE_DIR + \"/\" + testId), being deleted later by file.delete(). By adding some camouflage parameters to the url, an attacker can target files on the server. The vulnerability has been fixed in v2.4.1.","references":["https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/security/advisories/GHSA-5mwp-xw7p-5j27","https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/security/advisories/GHSA-5mwp-xw7p-5j27"]}
