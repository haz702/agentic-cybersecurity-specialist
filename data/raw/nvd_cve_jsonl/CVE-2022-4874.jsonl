In order to serve static content, the application performs a check for the existence of specific characters in the URL (.css, .png etc). If it exists, it performs a \"fake login\" to give the request an active session to load the file and not redirect to the login page.","references":["https://github.com/scarvell/advisories/blob/main/2022_netcomm_nf20mesh_unauth_rce.md","https://github.com/scarvell/advisories/blob/main/2022_netcomm_nf20mesh_unauth_rce.md"]}
