{"id":"CVE-2022-24552","publishedDate":"2022-02-06T21:15:08.073","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A flaw was found in the REST API in StarWind Stack. REST command, which manipulates a virtual disk, doesn\u2019t check input parameters. Some of them go directly to bash as part of a script. An attacker with non-root user access can inject arbitrary data into the command that will be executed with root privileges. This affects StarWind SAN and NAS v0.2 build 1633.","references":["https://www.starwindsoftware.com/security/sw-20220203-0001/","https://www.starwindsoftware.com/security/sw-20220203-0001/"]}
