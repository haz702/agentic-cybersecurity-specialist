{"id":"CVE-2025-1687","publishedDate":"2025-02-28T00:15:36.240","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Cardealer theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'update_user_profile' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the user email and password via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/car-dealer-automotive-wordpress-theme-responsive/8574708","https://webtemplatemasters.com/cardealer/changelog/#v165","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6305b7be-8651-4028-a8cf-ea58b4977225?source=cve"]}
