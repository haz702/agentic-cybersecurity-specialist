When the incoming template is controllable, it will be filtered by the DefaultNativeSecurityManager blacklist. Because blacklist filtering is not strict, the blacklist can be bypassed, leading to arbitrary code execution.","references":["https://gitee.com/xiandafu/beetl/issues/I8RU01","https://gitee.com/xiandafu/beetl/issues/I8RU01"]}
