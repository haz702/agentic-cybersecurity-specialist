{"id":"CVE-2021-44493","publishedDate":"2022-04-15T18:15:08.840","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An issue was discovered in YottaDB through r1.32 and V7.0-000 and FIS GT.M through V7.0-000. Using crafted input, an attacker can cause a call to $Extract to force an signed integer holding the size of a buffer to take on a large negative number, which is then used as the length of a memcpy call that occurs on the stack, causing a buffer overflow.","references":["http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-002_Release_Notes.html","https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/828","https://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/","http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-002_Release_Notes.html","https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/828","https://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/"]}
