{"id":"CVE-2021-43804","publishedDate":"2021-12-22T18:15:07.900","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's length, this declared length is not checked against the actual received packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all users that use PJMEDIA and RTCP. A malicious actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason length. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.","references":["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/8b621f192cae14456ee0b0ade52ce6c6f258af1e","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-3qx3-cg72-wrh9","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/8b621f192cae14456ee0b0ade52ce6c6f258af1e","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-3qx3-cg72-wrh9","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285"]}
