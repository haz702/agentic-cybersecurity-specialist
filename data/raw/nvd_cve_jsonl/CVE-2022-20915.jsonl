{"id":"CVE-2022-20915","publishedDate":"2022-10-10T21:15:10.340","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"A vulnerability in the implementation of IPv6 VPN over MPLS (6VPE) with Zone-Based Firewall (ZBFW) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper error handling of an IPv6 packet that is forwarded from an MPLS and ZBFW-enabled interface in a 6VPE deployment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet sourced from a device on the IPv6-enabled virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) interface through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reload the device, resulting in a DoS condition.","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-6vpe-dos-tJBtf5Zv","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-6vpe-dos-tJBtf5Zv"]}
