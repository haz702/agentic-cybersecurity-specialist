{"id":"CVE-2021-41150","publishedDate":"2021-10-19T20:15:08.263","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"Tough provides a set of Rust libraries and tools for using and generating the update framework (TUF) repositories. The tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does not properly sanitize delegated role names when caching a repository, or when loading a repository from the filesystem. When the repository is cached or loaded, files ending with the .json extension could be overwritten with role metadata anywhere on the system. A fix is available in version 0.12.0. No workarounds to this issue are known.","references":["https://github.com/awslabs/tough/commit/1809b9bd1106d78a51fbea3071aa97a3530bac9a","https://github.com/awslabs/tough/security/advisories/GHSA-r56q-vv3c-6g9c","https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-wjw6-2cqr-j4qr","https://github.com/awslabs/tough/commit/1809b9bd1106d78a51fbea3071aa97a3530bac9a","https://github.com/awslabs/tough/security/advisories/GHSA-r56q-vv3c-6g9c","https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-wjw6-2cqr-j4qr"]}
