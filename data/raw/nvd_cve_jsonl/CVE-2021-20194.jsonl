{"id":"CVE-2021-20194","publishedDate":"2021-02-23T23:15:13.100","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"There is a vulnerability in the linux kernel versions higher than 5.2 (if kernel compiled with config params CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y , CONFIG_BPF=y , CONFIG_CGROUPS=y , CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF=y , CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY not set, and BPF hook to getsockopt is registered). As result of BPF execution, the local user can trigger bug in __cgroup_bpf_run_filter_getsockopt() function that can lead to heap overflow (because of non-hardened usercopy). The impact of attack could be deny of service or possibly privileges escalation.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1912683","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210326-0003/","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1912683","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210326-0003/"]}
