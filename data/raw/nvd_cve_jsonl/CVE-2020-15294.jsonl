{"id":"CVE-2020-15294","publishedDate":"2020-12-17T17:15:12.987","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Compiler Optimization Removal or Modification of Security-critical Code vulnerability in IntPeParseUnwindData() results in multiple dereferences to the same pointer. If the pointer is located in memory-mapped from the guest space, this may cause a race-condition where the generated code would dereference the same address twice, thus obtaining different values, which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue affects: Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection versions prior to 1.132.2.","references":["https://www.bitdefender.com/support/security-advisories/compiler-optimization-removal-modification-security-critical-code-vulnerability-bitdefender-hypervisor-introspection-va-9339/","https://www.bitdefender.com/support/security-advisories/compiler-optimization-removal-modification-security-critical-code-vulnerability-bitdefender-hypervisor-introspection-va-9339/"]}
