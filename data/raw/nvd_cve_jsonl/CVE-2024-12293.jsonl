{"id":"CVE-2024-12293","publishedDate":"2024-12-17T09:15:05.347","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.64.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_roles() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or remove roles for arbitrary users, including escalating their privileges to administrator, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/user-role-editor/trunk/includes/classes/grant-roles.php#L184","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/user-role-editor/trunk/includes/classes/grant-roles.php#L187","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3208193/","https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6f359d02-d4ce-4045-9e79-ae0f92b84766?source=cve"]}
