{"id":"CVE-2025-24897","publishedDate":"2025-02-11T16:15:51.610","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF).","references":["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/77e421029cb564a97f42b6e41c9edce49f79cecd","https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-38w6-vx8g-67pp"]}
