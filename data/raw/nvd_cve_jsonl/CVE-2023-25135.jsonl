{"id":"CVE-2023-25135","publishedDate":"2023-02-03T05:15:10.737","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"vBulletin before 5.6.9 PL1 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTTP request that triggers deserialization. This occurs because verify_serialized checks that a value is serialized by calling unserialize and then checking for errors. The fixed versions are 5.6.7 PL1, 5.6.8 PL1, and 5.6.9 PL1.","references":["https://forum.vbulletin.com/forum/vbulletin-announcements/vbulletin-announcements_aa/4473890-vbulletin-5-6-9-security-patch","https://www.ambionics.io/blog/vbulletin-unserializable-but-unreachable","https://forum.vbulletin.com/forum/vbulletin-announcements/vbulletin-announcements_aa/4473890-vbulletin-5-6-9-security-patch","https://www.ambionics.io/blog/vbulletin-unserializable-but-unreachable"]}
