{"id":"CVE-2024-13684","publishedDate":"2025-02-18T05:15:18.050","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The Reset plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the reset_db_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset several tables in the database like comments, themes, plugins, and more via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/reset/tags/1.6/delete_comments.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2335533d-c38a-450c-9fa1-0e236b5e92e6?source=cve"]}
