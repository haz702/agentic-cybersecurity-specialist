{"id":"CVE-2024-6581","publishedDate":"2024-10-29T13:15:07.840","cvssV3":9.0,"description":"A vulnerability in the discussion image upload function of the Lollms application, version v9.9, allows for the uploading of SVG files. Due to incomplete filtering in the sanitize_svg function, this can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which in turn pose a risk of remote code execution. The sanitize_svg function only removes script elements and 'on*' event attributes, but does not account for other potential vectors for XSS within SVG files. This vulnerability can be exploited when authorized users access a malicious URL containing the crafted SVG file.","references":["https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/commit/328b960a0de2097e13654ac752253e9541521ddd","https://huntr.com/bounties/ad68ecd6-44e2-449b-8e7e-f2b71b1b43c7"]}
