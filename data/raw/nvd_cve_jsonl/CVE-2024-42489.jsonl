Missing escaping in the Viewpdf macro allows any user with view right on the `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` page or edit or comment right on any page to perform remote code execution. Other macros like Viewppt are vulnerable to the same kind of attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.1.","references":["https://github.com/xwikisas/xwiki-pro-macros/blob/main/xwiki-pro-macros-ui/src/main/resources/Confluence/Macros/Viewpdf.xml#L265-L267","https://github.com/xwikisas/xwiki-pro-macros/commit/199553c84901999481a20614f093af2d57970eba","https://github.com/xwikisas/xwiki-pro-macros/security/advisories/GHSA-cfq3-q227-7j65"]}
