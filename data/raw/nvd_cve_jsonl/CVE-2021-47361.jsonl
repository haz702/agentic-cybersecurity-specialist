{"id":"CVE-2021-47361","publishedDate":"2024-05-21T15:15:22.283","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmcb: fix error handling in mcb_alloc_bus()\n\nThere are two bugs:\n1) If ida_simple_get() fails then this code calls put_device(carrier)\n   but we haven't yet called get_device(carrier) and probably that\n   leads to a use after free.\n2) After device_initialize() then we need to use put_device() to\n   release the bus.  This will free the internal resources tied to the\n   device and call mcb_free_bus() which will free the rest.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/115b07d9f47e3996430b8f2007edd9768e1f807f","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/25a1433216489de4abc889910f744e952cb6dbae","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/66f74ba9be9daf9c47fface6af3677f602774f6b","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7751f609eadf36b1f53712bae430019c53a16eb0","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8a558261fa57a6deefb0925ab1829f698b194aea","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/91e4ad05bf18322b5921d1a6c9b603f6eb1694f0","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9fc198f415dee070a1de957bb5bf5921d8df3499","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/115b07d9f47e3996430b8f2007edd9768e1f807f","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/25a1433216489de4abc889910f744e952cb6dbae","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/66f74ba9be9daf9c47fface6af3677f602774f6b","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7751f609eadf36b1f53712bae430019c53a16eb0","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8a558261fa57a6deefb0925ab1829f698b194aea","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/91e4ad05bf18322b5921d1a6c9b603f6eb1694f0","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9fc198f415dee070a1de957bb5bf5921d8df3499"]}
