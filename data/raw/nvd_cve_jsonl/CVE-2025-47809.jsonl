{"id":"CVE-2025-47809","publishedDate":"2025-05-16T01:15:51.827","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"Wibu CodeMeter before 8.30a sometimes allows privilege escalation immediately after installation (before a logoff or reboot). For exploitation, there must have been an unprivileged installation with UAC, and the CodeMeter Control Center component must be installed, and the CodeMeter Control Center component must not have been restarted. In this scenario, the local user can navigate from Import License to a privileged instance of Windows Explorer.","references":["https://www.wibu.com/support/security-advisories/wibu-100120.html"]}
