{"id":"CVE-2024-47066","publishedDate":"2024-09-23T16:15:06.670","cvssV3":9.0,"description":"Lobe Chat is an open-source artificial intelligence chat framework. Prior to version 1.19.13, server-side request forgery protection implemented in `src/app/api/proxy/route.ts` does not consider redirect and could be bypassed when attacker provides an external malicious URL which redirects to internal resources like a private network or loopback address. Version 1.19.13 contains an improved fix for the issue.","references":["https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/blob/main/src/app/api/proxy/route.ts","https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/commit/e960a23b0c69a5762eb27d776d33dac443058faf","https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/security/advisories/GHSA-3fc8-2r3f-8wrg","https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/security/advisories/GHSA-mxhq-xw3g-rphc"]}
