{"id":"CVE-2024-21490","publishedDate":"2024-02-10T05:15:08.650","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"This affects versions of the package angular from 1.3.0. A regular expression used to split the value of the ng-srcset directive is vulnerable to super-linear runtime due to backtracking. With large carefully-crafted input, this can result in catastrophic backtracking and cause a denial of service. \r\r\r**Note:**\r\rThis package is EOL and will not receive any updates to address this issue. Users should migrate to [@angular/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/core).","references":["https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSBOWER-6241746","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-6241747","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-6091113","https://stackblitz.com/edit/angularjs-vulnerability-ng-srcset-redos","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSBOWER-6241746","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-6241747","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-6091113","https://stackblitz.com/edit/angularjs-vulnerability-ng-srcset-redos","https://support.herodevs.com/hc/en-us/articles/25715686953485-CVE-2024-21490-AngularJS-Regular-Expression-Denial-of-Service-ReDoS"]}
