{"id":"CVE-2024-6885","publishedDate":"2024-07-23T02:15:02.610","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The MaxiBlocks: 2200+ Patterns, 190 Pages, 14.2K Icons & 100 Styles plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the maxi_remove_custom_image_size and maxi_add_custom_image_size functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/maxi-blocks/tags/1.9.2/core/class-maxi-image-crop.php#L100","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/maxi-blocks/tags/1.9.2/core/class-maxi-image-crop.php#L42","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/maxi-blocks/tags/1.9.2/plugin.php#L221","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/249b08c5-7429-4690-9f08-fc3f049aa62c?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/maxi-blocks/tags/1.9.2/core/class-maxi-image-crop.php#L100","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/maxi-blocks/tags/1.9.2/core/class-maxi-image-crop.php#L42","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/maxi-blocks/tags/1.9.2/plugin.php#L221","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/249b08c5-7429-4690-9f08-fc3f049aa62c?source=cve"]}
