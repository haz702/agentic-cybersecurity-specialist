{"id":"CVE-2024-47613","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:32.740","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in `gst_gdk_pixbuf_dec_flush` within `gstgdkpixbufdec.c`. This function invokes `memcpy`, using `out_pix` as the destination address. `out_pix` is expected to point to the frame 0 from the frame structure, which is read from the input file. However, in certain situations, it can points to a NULL frame, causing the subsequent call to `memcpy` to attempt writing to the null address (0x00), leading to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8041.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0025.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-115_GHSL-2024-118_Gstreamer/"]}
