{"id":"CVE-2024-9779","publishedDate":"2024-12-17T23:15:05.603","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A flaw was found in Open Cluster Management (OCM) when a user has access to the worker nodes which contain the cluster-manager or klusterlet deployments. The cluster-manager deployment uses a service account with the same name \"cluster-manager\" which is bound to a ClusterRole also named \"cluster-manager\", which includes the permission to create Pod resources. If this deployment runs a pod on an attacker-controlled node, the attacker can obtain the cluster-manager's token and steal any service account token by creating and mounting the target service account to control the whole cluster.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9779","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2317916","https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/pull/325","https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/releases/tag/v0.13.0","https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/registration-operator/issues/361"]}
