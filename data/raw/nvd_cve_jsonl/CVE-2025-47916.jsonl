{"id":"CVE-2025-47916","publishedDate":"2025-05-16T15:15:48.357","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"Invision Community 5.0.0 before 5.0.7 allows remote code execution via crafted template strings to themeeditor.php. The issue lies within the themeeditor controller (file: /applications/core/modules/front/system/themeeditor.php), where a protected method named customCss can be invoked by unauthenticated users. This method passes the value of the content parameter to the Theme::makeProcessFunction() method; hence it is evaluated by the template engine. Accordingly, this can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by providing crafted template strings.","references":["https://invisioncommunity.com/release-notes-v5/507-r41/","https://karmainsecurity.com/KIS-2025-02","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/May/4","https://karmainsecurity.com/KIS-2025-02"]}
