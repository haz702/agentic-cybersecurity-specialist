{"id":"CVE-2025-3810","publishedDate":"2025-05-09T03:15:24.150","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password and email through the edit_profile_data() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses and passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3278939/wpbookit/trunk/core/admin/classes/controllers/class.wpb-profile-controller.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/54f1ebfb-67f1-461d-91f1-269b0a2c0653?source=cve"]}
