If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/print-science-designer/tags/1.3.152/includes/saved-projects.php#L120","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/print-science-designer/tags/1.3.153/includes/saved-projects.php#L120","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8008b5e2-f3b4-492c-8e50-b673f725b2b1?source=cve"]}
