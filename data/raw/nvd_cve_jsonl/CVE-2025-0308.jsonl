This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ultimate-member/tags/2.9.1/includes/core/class-member-directory.php#L1877","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e3e5bb98-2652-499a-b8cd-4ebfe1c1d890?source=cve"]}
