{"id":"CVE-2025-23166","publishedDate":"2025-05-19T02:15:17.470","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The C++ method SignTraits::DeriveBits() may incorrectly call ThrowException() based on user-supplied inputs when executing in a background thread, crashing the Node.js process. Such cryptographic operations are commonly applied to untrusted inputs. Thus, this mechanism potentially allows an adversary to remotely crash a Node.js runtime.","references":["https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/may-2025-security-releases"]}
