{"id":"CVE-2024-36474","publishedDate":"2024-10-03T16:15:05.010","cvssV3":8.4,"description":"An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the Compound Document Binary File format parser of the GNOME Project G Structured File Library (libgsf) version v1.14.52. A specially crafted file can result in an integer overflow when processing the directory from the file that allows for an out-of-bounds index to be used when reading and writing to an array. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.","references":["https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libgsf/-/issues/34","https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2068","https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2068"]}
