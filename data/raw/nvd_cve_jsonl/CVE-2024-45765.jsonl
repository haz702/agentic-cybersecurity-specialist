{"id":"CVE-2024-45765","publishedDate":"2024-11-08T16:15:23.350","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"Dell Enterprise SONiC OS, version(s) 4.1.x, 4.2.x, contain(s) an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability. A high privileged attacker with remote access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to Command execution. This is a critical severity vulnerability as it allows high privilege OS commands to be executed with a less privileged role; so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.","references":["https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000245655/dsa-2024-449-security-update-for-dell-enterprise-sonic-distribution-vulnerabilities"]}
