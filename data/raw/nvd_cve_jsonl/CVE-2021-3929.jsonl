{"id":"CVE-2021-3929","publishedDate":"2022-08-25T20:15:09.417","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the NVM Express Controller (NVME) emulation in QEMU. This CVE is similar to CVE-2021-3750 and, just like it, when the reentrancy write triggers the reset function nvme_ctrl_reset(), data structs will be freed leading to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition or, potentially, executing arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3929","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020298","https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/736b01642d85be832385","https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/556","https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/782","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XHNN7QJCEQH7AQG5AQP2GEFAQE6K635I/","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3929","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2020298","https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/736b01642d85be832385","https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/556","https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/782","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XHNN7QJCEQH7AQG5AQP2GEFAQE6K635I/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250228-0010/"]}
