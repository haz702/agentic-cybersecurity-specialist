{"id":"CVE-2024-0562","publishedDate":"2024-01-15T19:15:08.120","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. When a disk is removed, bdi_unregister is called to stop further write-back and waits for associated delayed work to complete. However, wb_inode_writeback_end() may schedule bandwidth estimation work after this has completed, which can result in the timer attempting to access the recently freed bdi_writeback.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0412","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0562","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258475","https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-mm/patch/20220801155034.3772543-1-khazhy@google.com/","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0412","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0562","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258475","https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-mm/patch/20220801155034.3772543-1-khazhy@google.com/"]}
