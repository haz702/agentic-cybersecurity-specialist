{"id":"CVE-2022-36115","publishedDate":"2022-08-25T23:15:08.257","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"An issue was discovered in Blue Prism Enterprise 6.0 through 7.01. In a misconfigured environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for an authenticated user to reverse engineer the Blue Prism software and circumvent access controls for unintended functionality. An attacker can abuse the CreateProcessAutosave() method to inject their own functionality into a development process. If (upon a warning) a user decides to recover unsaved work by using the last saved version, the malicious code could enter the workflow. Should the process action stages not be fully reviewed before publishing, this could result in the malicious code being run in a production environment.","references":["https://blueprism.com","https://community.blueprism.com/discussion/security-vulnerability-notification-ssc-blue-prism-enterprise","https://portal.blueprism.com/security-vulnerabilities-august-2022","https://blueprism.com","https://community.blueprism.com/discussion/security-vulnerability-notification-ssc-blue-prism-enterprise","https://portal.blueprism.com/security-vulnerabilities-august-2022"]}
