{"id":"CVE-2024-21576","publishedDate":"2024-12-13T12:15:19.753","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"ComfyUI-Bmad-Nodes is vulnerable to Code Injection. The issue stems from a validation bypass in the BuildColorRangeHSVAdvanced, FilterContour and FindContour custom nodes. In the entrypoint function to each node, there\u2019s a call to eval which can be triggered by generating a workflow that injects a crafted string into the node. This can result in executing arbitrary code on the server.","references":["https://github.com/bmad4ever/comfyui_bmad_nodes/blob/392af9490cbadf32a1fe92ff820ebabe88c51ee8/cv_nodes.py#L1814"]}
