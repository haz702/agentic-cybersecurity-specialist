{"id":"CVE-2020-25694","publishedDate":"2020-11-16T01:15:12.670","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"A flaw was found in PostgreSQL versions before 13.1, before 12.5, before 11.10, before 10.15, before 9.6.20 and before 9.5.24. If a client application that creates additional database connections only reuses the basic connection parameters while dropping security-relevant parameters, an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack, or the ability to observe clear-text transmissions, could exist. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894423","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/12/msg00005.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202012-07","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20201202-0003/","https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894423","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/12/msg00005.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202012-07","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20201202-0003/","https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/"]}
