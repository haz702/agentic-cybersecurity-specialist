{"id":"CVE-2022-20683","publishedDate":"2022-04-15T15:15:12.667","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"A vulnerability in the Application Visibility and Control (AVC-FNF) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient packet verification for traffic inspected by the AVC feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets from the wired network to a wireless client, resulting in the crafted packets being processed by the wireless controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash and reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c9800-fnf-dos-bOL5vLge","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c9800-fnf-dos-bOL5vLge"]}
