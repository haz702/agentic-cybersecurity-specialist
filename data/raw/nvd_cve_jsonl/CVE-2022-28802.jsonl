{"id":"CVE-2022-28802","publishedDate":"2022-09-21T20:15:10.027","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"Code by Zapier before 2022-08-17 allowed intra-account privilege escalation that included execution of Python or JavaScript code. In other words, Code by Zapier was providing a customer-controlled general-purpose virtual machine that unintentionally granted full access to all users of a company's account, but was supposed to enforce role-based access control within that company's account. Before 2022-08-17, a customer could have resolved this by (in effect) using a separate virtual machine for an application that held credentials - or other secrets - that weren't supposed to be shared among all of its employees. (Multiple accounts would have been needed to operate these independent virtual machines.)","references":["https://www.zenity.io/blog/zapescape-organization-wide-control-over-code-by-zapier/","https://www.zenity.io/blog/zapescape-vulnerability-disclosure/","https://www.zenity.io/blog/zapescape-organization-wide-control-over-code-by-zapier/","https://www.zenity.io/blog/zapescape-vulnerability-disclosure/"]}
