{"id":"CVE-2020-8006","publishedDate":"2024-04-12T12:15:41.467","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The server in Circontrol Raption through 5.11.2 has a pre-authentication stack-based buffer overflow that can be exploited to gain run-time control of the device as root. The ocpp1.5 and pwrstudio binaries on the charging station do not use a number of common exploitation mitigations. In particular, there are no stack canaries and they do not use the Position Independent Executable (PIE) format.","references":["https://circontrol.com/intelligent-charging-solutions/dc-chargers-series/raption-150/","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Mar/33","https://circontrol.com/intelligent-charging-solutions/dc-chargers-series/raption-150/","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Mar/33"]}
