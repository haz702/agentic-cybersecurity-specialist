{"id":"CVE-2023-50265","publishedDate":"2023-12-15T21:15:08.943","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Bazarr manages and downloads subtitles. Prior to 1.3.1, the /api/swaggerui/static endpoint in bazarr/app/ui.py does not validate the user-controlled filename variable and uses it in the send_file function, which leads to an arbitrary file read on the system. This issue is fixed in version 1.3.1.","references":["https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/commit/17add7fbb3ae1919a40d505470d499d46df9ae6b","https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/releases/tag/v1.3.1","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-192_GHSL-2023-194_bazarr/","https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/commit/17add7fbb3ae1919a40d505470d499d46df9ae6b","https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/releases/tag/v1.3.1","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-192_GHSL-2023-194_bazarr/"]}
