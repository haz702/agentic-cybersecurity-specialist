{"id":"CVE-2021-44152","publishedDate":"2021-12-13T04:15:07.180","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. Because /goform/change_password_process does not verify authentication or authorization, an unauthenticated user can change the password of any existing user. This allows an attacker to change the password of any known user, thereby preventing valid users from accessing the system and granting the attacker full access to that user's account.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165186/Reprise-License-Manager-14.2-Unauthenticated-Password-Change.html","https://reprisesoftware.com/admin/rlm-admin-download.php?&euagree=yes","https://www.reprisesoftware.com/RELEASE_NOTES","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165186/Reprise-License-Manager-14.2-Unauthenticated-Password-Change.html","https://reprisesoftware.com/admin/rlm-admin-download.php?&euagree=yes","https://www.reprisesoftware.com/RELEASE_NOTES"]}
