{"id":"CVE-2023-50868","publishedDate":"2024-02-14T16:15:45.377","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the \"NSEC3\" issue. The RFC 5155 specification implies that an algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain situations.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/16/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/16/3","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-50868","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1219826","https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5155","https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2024-01.html","https://gitlab.nic.cz/knot/knot-resolver/-/releases/v5.7.1","https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-50868","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00006.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00011.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6FV5O347JTX7P5OZA6NGO4MKTXRXMKOZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BUIP7T7Z4T3UHLXFWG6XIVDP4GYPD3AI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVRDSJVZKMCXKKPP6PNR62T7RWZ3YSDZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IGSLGKUAQTW5JPPZCMF5YPEYALLRUZZ6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PNNHZSZPG2E7NBMBNYPGHCFI4V4XRWNQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RGS7JN6FZXUSTC2XKQHH27574XOULYYJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVYA42BLXUCIDLD35YIJPJSHDIADNYMP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TEXGOYGW7DBS3N2QSSQONZ4ENIRQEAPG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UQESRWMJCF4JEYJEAKLRM6CT55GLJAB7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZDZFMEKQTZ4L7RY46FCENWFB5MDT263R/","https://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2024q1/017430.html","https://nlnetlabs.nl/news/2024/Feb/13/unbound-1.19.1-released/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240307-0008/","https://www.isc.org/blogs/2024-bind-security-release/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/16/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/16/3","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-50868","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1219826","https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5155","https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2024-01.html","https://gitlab.nic.cz/knot/knot-resolver/-/releases/v5.7.1","https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-50868","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00006.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00011.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6FV5O347JTX7P5OZA6NGO4MKTXRXMKOZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BUIP7T7Z4T3UHLXFWG6XIVDP4GYPD3AI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVRDSJVZKMCXKKPP6PNR62T7RWZ3YSDZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IGSLGKUAQTW5JPPZCMF5YPEYALLRUZZ6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PNNHZSZPG2E7NBMBNYPGHCFI4V4XRWNQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RGS7JN6FZXUSTC2XKQHH27574XOULYYJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVYA42BLXUCIDLD35YIJPJSHDIADNYMP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TEXGOYGW7DBS3N2QSSQONZ4ENIRQEAPG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UQESRWMJCF4JEYJEAKLRM6CT55GLJAB7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZDZFMEKQTZ4L7RY46FCENWFB5MDT263R/","https://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2024q1/017430.html","https://nlnetlabs.nl/news/2024/Feb/13/unbound-1.19.1-released/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240307-0008/","https://www.isc.org/blogs/2024-bind-security-release/"]}
