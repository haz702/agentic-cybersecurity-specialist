{"id":"CVE-2024-12264","publishedDate":"2025-01-07T05:15:17.047","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The PayU CommercePro Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.3. This is due to /wp-json/payu/v1/generate-user-token and /wp-json/payu/v1/get-shipping-cost  REST API endpoints not properly verifying a user's identity prior to setting the users ID and auth cookies. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new administrative user accounts.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/payu-india/tags/3.8.3/includes/class-payu-shipping-tax-api-calculation.php#L187","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/bf037e4a-2dd7-4296-b86b-635901d2d68f?source=cve"]}
