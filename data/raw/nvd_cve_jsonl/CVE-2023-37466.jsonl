{"id":"CVE-2023-37466","publishedDate":"2023-07-14T00:15:09.263","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"vm2 is an advanced vm/sandbox for Node.js. The library contains critical security issues and should not be used for production. The maintenance of the project has been discontinued. In vm2 for versions up to 3.9.19, `Promise` handler sanitization can be bypassed with the `@@species` accessor property allowing attackers to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code, potentially allowing remote code execution inside the context of vm2 sandbox.","references":["https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-cchq-frgv-rjh5","https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-cchq-frgv-rjh5"]}
