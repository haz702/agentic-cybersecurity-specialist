{"id":"CVE-2020-14209","publishedDate":"2020-09-02T17:15:11.547","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Dolibarr before 11.0.5 allows low-privilege users to upload files of dangerous types, leading to arbitrary code execution. This occurs because .pht and .phar files can be uploaded. Also, a .htaccess file can be uploaded to reconfigure access control (e.g., to let .noexe files be executed as PHP code to defeat the .noexe protection mechanism).","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/161955/Dolibarr-ERP-CRM-11.0.4-Bypass-Code-Execution.html","https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/releases/tag/11.0.5","https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/security-research-advisories/vuln/WLX-2020-012","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/161955/Dolibarr-ERP-CRM-11.0.4-Bypass-Code-Execution.html","https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/releases/tag/11.0.5","https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/security-research-advisories/vuln/WLX-2020-012"]}
