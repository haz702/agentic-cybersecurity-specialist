{"id":"CVE-2022-39241","publishedDate":"2022-11-02T17:15:17.187","cvssV3":7.6,"description":"Discourse is a platform for community discussion. A malicious admin could use this vulnerability to perform port enumeration on the local host or other hosts on the internal network, as well as against hosts on the Internet. Latest `stable`, `beta`, and `test-passed` versions are now patched. As a workaround, self-hosters can use `DISCOURSE_BLOCKED_IP_BLOCKS` env var (which overrides `blocked_ip_blocks` setting) to stop webhooks from accessing private IPs.","references":["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-rcc5-28r3-23rr","https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-rcc5-28r3-23rr"]}
