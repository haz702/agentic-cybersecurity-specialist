{"id":"CVE-2022-21546","publishedDate":"2025-05-02T22:15:15.290","cvssV3":7.7,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: target: Fix WRITE_SAME No Data Buffer crash\n\nIn newer version of the SBC specs, we have a NDOB bit that indicates there\nis no data buffer that gets written out. If this bit is set using commands\nlike \"sg_write_same --ndob\" we will crash in target_core_iblock/file's\nexecute_write_same handlers when we go to access the se_cmd->t_data_sg\nbecause its NULL.\n\nThis patch adds a check for the NDOB bit in the common WRITE SAME code\nbecause we don't support it. And, it adds a check for zero SG elements in\neach handler in case the initiator tries to send a normal WRITE SAME with\nno data buffer.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4226622647e3e5ac06d3ebc1605b917446157510","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ccd3f449052449a917a3e577d8ba0368f43b8f29","https://git.kernel.org/linus/ccd3f449052449a917a3e577d8ba0368f43b8f29","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2022-21546.html","https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220628022325.14627-2-michael.christie@oracle.com/"]}
