Prior to 10.11.2, providing a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.2.","references":["https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/7d2a1392f43613094de700062aba168a9400dd3b","https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-632p-p495-25m5","https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/7d2a1392f43613094de700062aba168a9400dd3b","https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-632p-p495-25m5"]}
