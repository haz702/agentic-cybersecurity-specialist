{"id":"CVE-2024-5991","publishedDate":"2024-08-27T19:15:18.080","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In function MatchDomainName(), input param str is treated as a NULL terminated string despite being user provided and unchecked. Specifically, the function X509_check_host() takes in a pointer and length to check against, with no requirements that it be NULL terminated. If a caller was attempting to do a name check on a non-NULL terminated buffer, the code would read beyond the bounds of the input array until it found a NULL terminator.This issue affects wolfSSL: through 5.7.0.","references":["https://https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7604","https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/7604"]}
