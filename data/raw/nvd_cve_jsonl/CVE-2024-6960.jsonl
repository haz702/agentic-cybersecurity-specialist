{"id":"CVE-2024-6960","publishedDate":"2024-07-21T10:15:04.497","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The H2O machine learning platform uses \"Iced\" classes as the primary means of moving Java Objects around the cluster. The Iced format supports inclusion of serialized Java objects. When a model is deserialized, any class is allowed to be deserialized (no class whitelist). An attacker can construct a crafted Iced model that uses Java gadgets and leads to arbitrary code execution when imported to the H2O platform.","references":["https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/h2o-model-deserialization-rce-jfsa-2024-001035518/","https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/h2o-model-deserialization-rce-jfsa-2024-001035518/","https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ai.h2o/h2o-core"]}
