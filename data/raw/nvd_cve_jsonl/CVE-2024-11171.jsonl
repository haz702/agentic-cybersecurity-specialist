{"id":"CVE-2024-11171","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:24.437","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In danny-avila/librechat version git 0c2a583, there is an improper input validation vulnerability. The application uses multer middleware for handling multipart file uploads. When using in-memory storage (the default setting for multer), there is no limit on the upload file size. This can lead to a server crash due to out-of-memory errors when handling large files. An attacker without any privileges can exploit this vulnerability to cause a complete denial of service. The issue is fixed in version 0.7.6.","references":["https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat/commit/bb58a2d0662ef86dc75a9d2f6560125c018e3836","https://huntr.com/bounties/91717a5a-d653-4e35-b186-9e8d00aa4285"]}
