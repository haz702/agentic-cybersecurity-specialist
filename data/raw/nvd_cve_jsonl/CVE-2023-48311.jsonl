{"id":"CVE-2023-48311","publishedDate":"2023-12-08T20:15:07.573","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"dockerspawner is a tool to spawn JupyterHub single user servers in Docker containers. Users of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with 0.11.0 without specifying `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users to launch _any_ pullable docker image, instead of restricting to only the single configured image, as intended. This issue has been addressed in commit `3ba4b665b` which has been included in dockerspawner release version 13. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should explicitly set `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended default behavior.","references":["https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/commit/3ba4b665b6ca6027ea7a032d7ca3eab977574626","https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/security/advisories/GHSA-hfgr-h3vc-p6c2","https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/commit/3ba4b665b6ca6027ea7a032d7ca3eab977574626","https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/security/advisories/GHSA-hfgr-h3vc-p6c2"]}
