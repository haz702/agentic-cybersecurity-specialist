NOTE: the vendor's position is that this is an intended feature; also, it exists in the Supabase dashboard product, not the Supabase PostgreSQL product. Specifically, /pg_meta/default/query is for SQL queries that are entered in an intended UI by an authorized user. Nothing is injected.","references":["https://app.flows.sh:8443/project/default%2C","https://github.com/940198871/Vulnerability-details/blob/main/CVE-2024-24213","https://postfixadmin.ballardini.com.ar:8443/project/default/logs/explorer.","https://reference1.example.com/project/default/logs/explorer%2C","https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview#the-sql-editor","https://app.flows.sh:8443/project/default%2C","https://github.com/940198871/Vulnerability-details/blob/main/CVE-2024-24213","https://postfixadmin.ballardini.com.ar:8443/project/default/logs/explorer.","https://reference1.example.com/project/default/logs/explorer%2C","https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview#the-sql-editor"]}
