A Bypass of Two-Factor Authentication can occur under the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge endpoint. Because only the client-side verifies whether a check was successful, an attacker can modify the response, and fool the application into concluding that the TOTP was correct.","references":["https://www.gruppotim.it/it/footer/red-team.html","https://www.gruppotim.it/it/footer/red-team.html"]}
