{"id":"CVE-2023-1078","publishedDate":"2023-03-27T21:15:10.520","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of a list causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info *info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled by local user. It is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of bounds access, and a lock corruption.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/05/1","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=f753a68980cf4b59a80fe677619da2b1804f526d","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00005.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00006.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230505-0004/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/05/1","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=f753a68980cf4b59a80fe677619da2b1804f526d","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00005.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00006.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230505-0004/"]}
