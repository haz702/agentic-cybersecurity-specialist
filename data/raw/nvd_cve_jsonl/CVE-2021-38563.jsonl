{"id":"CVE-2021-38563","publishedDate":"2021-08-11T22:15:08.613","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in Foxit PDF Reader before 11.0.1 and PDF Editor before 11.0.1. It mishandles situations in which an array size (derived from a /Size entry) is smaller than the maximum indirect object number, and thus there is an attempted incorrect array access (leading to a NULL pointer dereference, or out-of-bounds read or write).","references":["https://www.foxitsoftware.com/support/security-bulletins.php","https://www.foxitsoftware.com/support/security-bulletins.php"]}
