A Local FIle Inclusion vulnerability exists in the downloadCsvAction function of the CustomReportController class (bundles/AdminBundle/Controller/Reports/CustomReportController.php). An authenticated user can reach this function with a GET request at the following endpoint: /admin/reports/custom-report/download-csv?exportFile=&91;filename].
