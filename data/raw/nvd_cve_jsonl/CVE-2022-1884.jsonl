{"id":"CVE-2022-1884","publishedDate":"2024-11-15T11:15:07.803","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A remote command execution vulnerability exists in gogs/gogs versions <=0.12.7 when deployed on a Windows server. The vulnerability arises due to improper validation of the `tree_path` parameter during file uploads. An attacker can set `tree_path=.git.` to upload a file into the .git directory, allowing them to write or rewrite the `.git/config` file. If the `core.sshCommand` is set, this can lead to remote command execution.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/9cd4e7b7-0979-4e5e-9a1c-388b58dea76b"]}
