{"id":"CVE-2024-8765","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:44.103","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"In lunary-ai/lunary, the privilege check mechanism is flawed in version git afc5df4. The system incorrectly identifies certain endpoints as public if the path contains '/auth/' anywhere within it. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive endpoints by including '/auth/' in the path. As a result, attackers can obtain and modify sensitive data and utilize other organizations' resources without proper authentication.","references":["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/7ff89b0304d191534b924cf063f3648206d497fa","https://huntr.com/bounties/4908cfcf-607a-412a-9635-966cbb08bb49"]}
