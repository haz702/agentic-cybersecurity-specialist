Up to and including commit 71f81f7f20cd26fd707335bca9838fa3e7df20d2, ReVanced API lacks error caching causing rate limit to be triggered thus increasing server load. This causes a denial of service for all users using the API.  It is recommended to implement proper error caching.\n","references":["https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-api/security/advisories/GHSA-852x-grxp-8p3q","https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-api/security/advisories/GHSA-852x-grxp-8p3q"]}
