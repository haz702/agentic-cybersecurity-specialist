{"id":"CVE-2023-0340","publishedDate":"2023-03-20T16:15:12.000","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Custom Content Shortcode WordPress plugin through 4.0.2 does not validate one of its shortcode attribute, which could allow users with a contributor role and above to include arbitrary files via a traversal attack. This could also allow them to read non PHP files and retrieve their content. RCE could also be achieved if the attacker manage to upload a malicious image containing PHP code, and then include it via the affected attribute, on a default WP install, authors could easily achieve that given that they have the upload_file capability.","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/71956598-90aa-4557-947a-c4716674543d","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/71956598-90aa-4557-947a-c4716674543d"]}
