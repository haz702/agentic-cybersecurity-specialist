{"id":"CVE-2024-47598","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:31.283","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been discovered in the qtdemux_merge_sample_table function within qtdemux.c. The problem is that the size of the stts buffer isn\u2019t properly checked before reading stts_duration, allowing the program to read 4 bytes beyond the boundaries of stts->data. This vulnerability reads up to 4 bytes past the allocated bounds of the stts array. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8059.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0006.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-246_Gstreamer/"]}
