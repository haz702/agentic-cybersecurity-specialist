{"id":"CVE-2024-6318","publishedDate":"2024-07-04T09:15:04.653","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The IMGspider plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'upload_img_file' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/imgspider/tags/2.3.10/classes/post.class.php#L122","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3107741/imgspider","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/306f00e4-9a70-48be-a91e-e396643a8129?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/imgspider/tags/2.3.10/classes/post.class.php#L122","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3107741/imgspider","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/306f00e4-9a70-48be-a91e-e396643a8129?source=cve"]}
