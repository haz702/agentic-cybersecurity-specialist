{"id":"CVE-2023-0461","publishedDate":"2023-02-28T15:15:11.550","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"There is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel which can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS\u00a0or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP\u00a0has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege.\n\nThere is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data\u00a0of a struct inet_connection_sock.\n\nWhen CONFIG_TLS\u00a0is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable.\n\nThe setsockopt\u00a0TCP_ULP\u00a0operation does not require any privilege.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit\u00a02c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c","references":["https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c","https://kernel.dance/#2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00005.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00006.html","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c","https://kernel.dance/#2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00005.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00006.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230331-0006/"]}
