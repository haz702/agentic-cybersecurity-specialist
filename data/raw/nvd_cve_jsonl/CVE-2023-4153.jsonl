{"id":"CVE-2023-4153","publishedDate":"2023-09-13T03:15:08.730","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The BAN Users plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 1.5.3 due to a missing capability check on the 'w3dev_save_ban_user_settings_callback' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify the plugin settings to access the ban and unban functionality and set the role of the unbanned user.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ban-users/tags/1.5.3/include/ajax.php#L109","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ban-users/tags/1.5.3/include/ajax.php#L199","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/af6bd2db-47a4-4381-a881-d5f97a159f8d?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ban-users/tags/1.5.3/include/ajax.php#L109","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ban-users/tags/1.5.3/include/ajax.php#L199","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/af6bd2db-47a4-4381-a881-d5f97a159f8d?source=cve"]}
