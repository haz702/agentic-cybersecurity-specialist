{"id":"CVE-2022-2433","publishedDate":"2022-09-06T18:15:13.590","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The WordPress Infinite Scroll \u2013 Ajax Load More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'alm_repeaters_export' parameter in versions up to, and including 5.5.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to call files using a PHAR wrapper, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link, that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2772627/ajax-load-more/trunk/admin/admin.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/040ae20d-93e3-4c65-ba74-4ff0b5c1afc7?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2433","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2772627/ajax-load-more/trunk/admin/admin.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/040ae20d-93e3-4c65-ba74-4ff0b5c1afc7?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2433"]}
