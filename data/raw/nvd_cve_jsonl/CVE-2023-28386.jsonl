{"id":"CVE-2023-28386","publishedDate":"2023-05-22T20:15:10.250","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"Snap One OvrC Pro devices versions 7.2 and prior do not validate firmware updates correctly. The device only calculates the MD5 hash of the firmware and does not check using a private-public key mechanism. The lack of complete PKI system firmware signature could allow attackers to upload arbitrary firmware updates, resulting in code execution.","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-136-01","https://www.control4.com/docs/product/ovrc-software/release-notes/english/latest/ovrc-software-release-notes-rev-p.pdf","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-136-01","https://www.control4.com/docs/product/ovrc-software/release-notes/english/latest/ovrc-software-release-notes-rev-p.pdf"]}
