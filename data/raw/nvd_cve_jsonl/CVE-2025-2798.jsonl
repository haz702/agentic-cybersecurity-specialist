{"id":"CVE-2025-2798","publishedDate":"2025-04-04T14:15:22.293","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Woffice CRM theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.21. This is due to a misconfiguration of excluded roles during registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register with an Administrator role if a custom login form is being used. This can be combined with CVE-2025-2797 to bypass the user approval process if an Administrator can be tricked into taking an action such as clicking a link.","references":["http://localhost/wp-content/themes/woffice/inc/classes/Woffice_Register.php#L405","https://hub.woffice.io/woffice/changelog#april-1st-2025-version-5422","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6dd6169b-bc94-4642-8975-2e96bc01576f?source=cve"]}
