{"id":"CVE-2022-1319","publishedDate":"2022-08-31T16:15:09.410","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A flaw was found in Undertow. For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly sending two response packets, and those packets have the reuse flag set even though JBoss EAP closes the connection. A failure occurs when the connection is reused after a 400 by CPING since it reads in the second SEND_HEADERS response packet instead of a CPONG.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1319","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073890","https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow/commit/1443a1a2bbb8e32e56788109d8285db250d55c8b","https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow/commit/7c5b3ab885b5638fd3f1e8a935d5063d68aa2df3","https://issues.redhat.com/browse/UNDERTOW-2060","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221014-0006/","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1319","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073890","https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow/commit/1443a1a2bbb8e32e56788109d8285db250d55c8b","https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow/commit/7c5b3ab885b5638fd3f1e8a935d5063d68aa2df3","https://issues.redhat.com/browse/UNDERTOW-2060","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221014-0006/"]}
