An attacker in radio range can achieve arbitrary read/write access to protected GATT service data, cause a denial of service, or possibly control a device's function by establishing an encrypted session with an unauthenticated Long Term Key (LTK).","references":["http://www.ti.com/tool/BLE-STACK","https://asset-group.github.io/cves.html","https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/","http://www.ti.com/tool/BLE-STACK","https://asset-group.github.io/cves.html","https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/"]}
