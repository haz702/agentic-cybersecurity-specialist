{"id":"CVE-2024-47723","publishedDate":"2024-10-21T13:15:02.503","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\njfs: fix out-of-bounds in dbNextAG() and diAlloc()\n\nIn dbNextAG() , there is no check for the case where bmp->db_numag is\ngreater or same than MAXAG due to a polluted image, which causes an\nout-of-bounds. Therefore, a bounds check should be added in dbMount().\n\nAnd in dbNextAG(), a check for the case where agpref is greater than\nbmp->db_numag should be added, so an out-of-bounds exception should be\nprevented.\n\nAdditionally, a check for the case where agno is greater or same than\nMAXAG should be added in diAlloc() to prevent out-of-bounds.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0338e66cba272351ca9d7d03f3628e390e70963b","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/128d5cfdcf844cb690c9295a3a1c1114c21fc15a","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5ad6284c8d433f8a213111c5c44ead4d9705b622","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6ce8b6ab44a8b5918c0ee373d4ad19d19017931b","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/96855f40e152989c9e7c20c4691ace5581098acc","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c1ba4b8ca799ff1d99d01f37d7ccb7d5ba5533d2","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d1017d2a0f3f16dc1db5120e7ddbe7c6680425b0","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e63866a475562810500ea7f784099bfe341e761a","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ead82533278502428883085a787d5a00f15e5eb9"]}
