{"id":"CVE-2025-26599","publishedDate":"2025-02-25T16:15:39.163","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"An access to an uninitialized pointer flaw was found in X.Org and Xwayland. The function compCheckRedirect() may fail if it cannot allocate the backing pixmap. In that case, compRedirectWindow() will return a BadAlloc error without validating the window tree marked just before, which leaves the validated data partly initialized and the use of an uninitialized pointer later.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2500","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2502","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2861","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2862","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2865","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2866","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2873","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2874","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2875","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2879","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2880","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7163","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7165","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7458","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-26599","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2345253"]}
