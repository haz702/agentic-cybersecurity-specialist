{"id":"CVE-2022-2933","publishedDate":"2023-02-06T19:15:09.687","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The 0mk Shortener plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the zeromk_options_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via the 'zeromk_user' and 'zeromk_apikluc' parameters through a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/0mk-shortener/trunk/0mk.php#L28","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3b798c64-3434-427d-b578-5abbdac8cd0e","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/0mk-shortener/trunk/0mk.php#L28","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3b798c64-3434-427d-b578-5abbdac8cd0e"]}
