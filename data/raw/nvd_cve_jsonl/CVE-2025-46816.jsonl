{"id":"CVE-2025-46816","publishedDate":"2025-05-06T19:16:00.080","cvssV3":9.4,"description":"goshs is a SimpleHTTPServer written in Go. Starting in version 0.3.4 and prior to version 1.0.5, running goshs without arguments makes it possible for anyone to execute commands on the server. The function `dispatchReadPump` does not checks the option cli `-c`, thus allowing anyone to execute arbitrary command through the use of websockets. Version 1.0.5 fixes the issue.","references":["https://github.com/patrickhener/goshs/commit/160220974576afe5111485b8d12fd36058984cfa","https://github.com/patrickhener/goshs/security/advisories/GHSA-rwj2-w85g-5cmm"]}
