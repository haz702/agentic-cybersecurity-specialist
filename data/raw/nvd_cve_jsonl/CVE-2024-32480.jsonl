{"id":"CVE-2024-32480","publishedDate":"2024-04-22T23:15:50.440","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. Versions prior to 24.4.0 are vulnerable to SQL injection. The `order` parameter is obtained from `$request`. After performing a string check, the value is directly incorporated into an SQL statement and concatenated, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker may extract a whole database this way. Version 24.4.0 fixes the issue.","references":["https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/83fe4b10c440d69a47fe2f8616e290ba2bd3a27c","https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-jh57-j3vq-h438","https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/83fe4b10c440d69a47fe2f8616e290ba2bd3a27c","https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-jh57-j3vq-h438"]}
