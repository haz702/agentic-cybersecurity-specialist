Element Android version 1.4.3 through 1.6.10 is vulnerable to intent redirection, allowing a third-party malicious application to start any internal activity by passing some extra parameters. Possible impact includes making Element Android display an arbitrary web page, executing arbitrary JavaScript; bypassing PIN code protection; and account takeover by spawning a login screen to send credentials to an arbitrary home server. This issue is fixed in Element Android 1.6.12. There is no known workaround to mitigate the issue.","references":["https://element.io/blog/security-release-element-android-1-6-12","https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/commit/53734255ec270b0814946350787393dfcaa2a5a9","https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/security/advisories/GHSA-j6pr-fpc8-q9vm","https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/9267555?hl=en","https://element.io/blog/security-release-element-android-1-6-12","https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/commit/53734255ec270b0814946350787393dfcaa2a5a9","https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/security/advisories/GHSA-j6pr-fpc8-q9vm","https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/9267555?hl=en"]}
