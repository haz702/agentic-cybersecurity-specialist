{"id":"CVE-2022-36227","publishedDate":"2022-11-22T02:15:11.003","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"In libarchive before 3.6.2, the software does not check for an error after calling calloc function that can return with a NULL pointer if the function fails, which leads to a resultant NULL pointer dereference. NOTE: the discoverer cites this CWE-476 remark but third parties dispute the code-execution impact: \"In rare circumstances, when NULL is equivalent to the 0x0 memory address and privileged code can access it, then writing or reading memory is possible, which may lead to code execution.\"","references":["https://bugs.gentoo.org/882521","https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/blob/v3.0.0a/libarchive/archive_write.c#L215","https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/1754","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00034.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/V67OO2UUQAUJS3IK4JZPF6F3LUCBU6IS/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-14","https://bugs.gentoo.org/882521","https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/blob/v3.0.0a/libarchive/archive_write.c#L215","https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/1754","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00034.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/V67OO2UUQAUJS3IK4JZPF6F3LUCBU6IS/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-14"]}
