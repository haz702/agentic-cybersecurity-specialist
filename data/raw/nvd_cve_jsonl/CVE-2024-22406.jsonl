{"id":"CVE-2024-22406","publishedDate":"2024-01-16T23:15:08.233","cvssV3":9.3,"description":"Shopware is an open headless commerce platform. The Shopware application API contains a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters in the \u201caggregations\u201d object. The \u2018name\u2019 field in this \u201caggregations\u201d object is vulnerable SQL-injection and can be exploited using time-based SQL-queries.  This issue has been addressed and users are advised to update to Shopware 6.5.7.4. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.","references":["https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-qmp9-2xwj-m6m9","https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-qmp9-2xwj-m6m9"]}
