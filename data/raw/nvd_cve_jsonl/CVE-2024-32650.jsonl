When using a blocking rustls server, if a client send a `close_notify` message immediately after `client_hello`, the server's `complete_io` will get in an infinite loop. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.23.5, 0.22.4, and 0.21.11.","references":["https://github.com/rustls/rustls/commit/2123576840aa31043a31b0770e6572136fbe0c2d","https://github.com/rustls/rustls/commit/6e938bcfe82a9da7a2e1cbf10b928c7eca26426e","https://github.com/rustls/rustls/commit/f45664fbded03d833dffd806503d3c8becd1b71e","https://github.com/rustls/rustls/security/advisories/GHSA-6g7w-8wpp-frhj","https://github.com/rustls/rustls/commit/2123576840aa31043a31b0770e6572136fbe0c2d","https://github.com/rustls/rustls/commit/6e938bcfe82a9da7a2e1cbf10b928c7eca26426e","https://github.com/rustls/rustls/commit/f45664fbded03d833dffd806503d3c8becd1b71e","https://github.com/rustls/rustls/security/advisories/GHSA-6g7w-8wpp-frhj"]}
