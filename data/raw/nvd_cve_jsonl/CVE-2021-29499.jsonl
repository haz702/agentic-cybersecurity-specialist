{"id":"CVE-2021-29499","publishedDate":"2021-05-07T21:15:07.377","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"SIF is an open source implementation of the Singularity Container Image Format. The `siftool new` command and func siftool.New() produce predictable UUID identifiers due to insecure randomness in the version of the `github.com/satori/go.uuid` module used as a dependency. A patch is available in version >= v1.2.3 of the module. Users are encouraged to upgrade. As a workaround, users passing CreateInfo struct should ensure the `ID` field is generated using a version of `github.com/satori/go.uuid` that is not vulnerable to this issue.","references":["https://github.com/sylabs/sif/security/advisories/GHSA-4gh8-x3vv-phhg","https://github.com/sylabs/sif/security/advisories/GHSA-4gh8-x3vv-phhg"]}
