{"id":"CVE-2021-22946","publishedDate":"2021-09-29T20:15:08.187","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A user can tell curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly crafted but perfectly legitimate response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Mar/29","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1334111","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/08/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/APOAK4X73EJTAPTSVT7IRVDMUWVXNWGD/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RWLEC6YVEM2HWUBX67SDGPSY4CQB72OE/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202212-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211029-0003/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220121-0008/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213183","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5197","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Mar/29","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/1334111","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00022.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/08/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/APOAK4X73EJTAPTSVT7IRVDMUWVXNWGD/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RWLEC6YVEM2HWUBX67SDGPSY4CQB72OE/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202212-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211029-0003/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220121-0008/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213183","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5197","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"]}
