{"id":"CVE-2024-5751","publishedDate":"2024-06-27T19:15:16.160","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"BerriAI/litellm version v1.35.8 contains a vulnerability where an attacker can achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability exists in the `add_deployment` function, which decodes and decrypts environment variables from base64 and assigns them to `os.environ`. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malicious payload to the `/config/update` endpoint, which is then processed and executed by the server when the `get_secret` function is triggered. This requires the server to use Google KMS and a database to store a model.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/ae623c2f-b64b-4245-9ed4-f13a0a5824ce","https://huntr.com/bounties/ae623c2f-b64b-4245-9ed4-f13a0a5824ce"]}
