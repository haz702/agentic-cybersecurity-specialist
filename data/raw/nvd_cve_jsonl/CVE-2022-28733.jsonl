{"id":"CVE-2022-28733","publishedDate":"2023-07-20T01:15:10.140","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"Integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets; A malicious crafted IP packet can lead to an integer underflow in grub_net_recv_ip4_packets() function on rsm->total_len value. Under certain circumstances the total_len value may end up wrapping around to a small integer number which will be used in memory allocation. If the attack succeeds in such way, subsequent operations can write past the end of the buffer.","references":["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-28733","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230825-0002/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/07/5","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-28733","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230825-0002/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/07/5"]}
