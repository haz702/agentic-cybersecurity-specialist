{"id":"CVE-2024-10952","publishedDate":"2024-12-04T03:15:04.593","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"The The Authors List plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via update_authors_list_ajax AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.4. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/authors-list/tags/2.0.4/backend/includes/class-authors-list-item.php#L843","https://wordpress.org/plugins/authors-list/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8b3cfe0a-dcfb-40f3-ba43-4e838c113010?source=cve","https://www.wpkube.com/"]}
