{"id":"CVE-2023-3063","publishedDate":"2023-06-30T02:15:09.457","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 4.67. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges or above, to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sp-client-document-manager/trunk/classes/ajax.php#L149","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6dc2e720-85d9-42d9-94ef-eb172425993d?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sp-client-document-manager/trunk/classes/ajax.php#L149","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6dc2e720-85d9-42d9-94ef-eb172425993d?source=cve"]}
