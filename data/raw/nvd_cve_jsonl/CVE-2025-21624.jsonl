{"id":"CVE-2025-21624","publishedDate":"2025-01-07T16:15:40.853","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. Prior to 5.5.1 - 239, a file upload vulnerability exists in the Manage Playlist functionality of the application, specifically surrounding the uploading of playlist cover images. Without proper checks, an attacker can upload a PHP script file instead of an image file, thus allowing a webshell or other malicious files to be stored and executed on the server. This attack vector exists in both the admin area and low-level user area. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 - 239.","references":["https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/893bfb0f1236c4a59b5e2843ab8d27a1e491b12b","https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-98vm-2xqm-xrcc","https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-98vm-2xqm-xrcc"]}
