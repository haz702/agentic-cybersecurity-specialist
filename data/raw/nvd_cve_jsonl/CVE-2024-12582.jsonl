{"id":"CVE-2024-12582","publishedDate":"2024-12-24T04:15:05.137","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"A flaw was found in the skupper console,  a read-only interface that renders cluster network, traffic details, and metrics for a network application that a user sets up across a hybrid multi-cloud environment. When the default authentication method is used, a random password is generated for the \"admin\" user and is persisted in either a Kubernetes secret or a podman volume in a plaintext file. This authentication method can be manipulated by an attacker, leading to the reading of any user-readable file in the container filesystem, directly impacting data confidentiality. Additionally, the attacker may induce skupper to read extremely large files into memory, resulting in resource exhaustion and a denial of service attack.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:1413","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-12582","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2333540"]}
