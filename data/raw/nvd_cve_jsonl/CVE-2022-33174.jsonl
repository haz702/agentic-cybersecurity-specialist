{"id":"CVE-2022-33174","publishedDate":"2022-06-13T18:15:10.230","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Power Distribution Units running on Powertek firmware (multiple brands) before 3.30.30 allows remote authorization bypass in the web interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields that contain the username and password in cleartext.","references":["https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&id=748","https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&id=748"]}
