{"id":"CVE-2024-5343","publishedDate":"2024-06-19T06:15:11.723","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Photo Gallery, Images, Slider in Rbs Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.19. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'rbs_ajax_create_article' and 'rbs_ajax_reset_views' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new posts and reset gallery view counts via a forged request granted they can trick a Contributor+ level user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/robo-gallery/tags/3.2.19/includes/extensions/rbs_create_post_ajax.php#L247","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/robo-gallery/tags/3.2.19/includes/extensions/rbs_create_post_ajax.php#L94","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/robo-gallery/tags/3.2.19/includes/rbs_gallery_ajax.php#L19","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3100759/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/045fbe5b-0e63-4820-97a7-017dd72eb73a?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/robo-gallery/tags/3.2.19/includes/extensions/rbs_create_post_ajax.php#L247","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/robo-gallery/tags/3.2.19/includes/extensions/rbs_create_post_ajax.php#L94","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/robo-gallery/tags/3.2.19/includes/rbs_gallery_ajax.php#L19","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3100759/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/045fbe5b-0e63-4820-97a7-017dd72eb73a?source=cve"]}
