{"id":"CVE-2023-28445","publishedDate":"2023-03-24T00:15:15.653","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust. Resizable ArrayBuffers passed to asynchronous functions that are shrunk during the asynchronous operation could result in an out-of-bound read/write. It is unlikely that this has been exploited in the wild, as the only version affected is Deno 1.32.0. Deno Deploy users are not affected. The problem has been resolved by disabling resizable ArrayBuffers temporarily in Deno 1.32.1. Deno 1.32.2 will re-enable resizable ArrayBuffers with a proper fix. As a workaround, run with `--v8-flags=--no-harmony-rab-gsab` to disable resizable ArrayBuffers.","references":["https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/18395","https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.32.1","https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-c25x-cm9x-qqgx","https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/18395","https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.32.1","https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-c25x-cm9x-qqgx"]}
