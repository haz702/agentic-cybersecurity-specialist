{"id":"CVE-2021-41065","publishedDate":"2021-12-14T16:15:09.020","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"An issue was discovered in Listary through 6. An attacker can create a \\\\.\\pipe\\Listary.listaryService named pipe and wait for a privileged user to open a session on the Listary installed host. Listary will automatically access the named pipe and the attacker will be able to duplicate the victim's token to impersonate him. This exploit is valid in certain Windows versions (Microsoft has patched the issue in later Windows 10 builds).","references":["https://medium.com/%40tomerp_77017/exploiting-listary-searching-your-way-to-system-privileges-8175af676c3e","https://www.listary.com/download","https://medium.com/%40tomerp_77017/exploiting-listary-searching-your-way-to-system-privileges-8175af676c3e","https://www.listary.com/download"]}
