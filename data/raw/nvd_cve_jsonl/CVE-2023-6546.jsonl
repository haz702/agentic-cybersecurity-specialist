{"id":"CVE-2023-6546","publishedDate":"2023-12-21T20:15:08.260","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"A race condition was found in the GSM 0710 tty multiplexor in the Linux kernel. This issue occurs when two threads execute the GSMIOC_SETCONF ioctl on the same tty file descriptor with the gsm line discipline enabled, and can lead to a use-after-free problem on a struct gsm_dlci while restarting the gsm mux. This could allow a local unprivileged user to escalate their privileges on the system.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0930","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0937","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1018","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1019","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1055","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1250","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1253","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1306","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1607","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1612","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1614","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2093","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2394","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2621","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2697","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4577","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4729","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4731","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4970","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6546","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2255498","https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3c4f8333b582487a2d1e02171f1465531cde53e3","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-CAN-20527","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/10/18","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/10/21","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/11/7","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/11/9","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/16/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/17/1","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0930","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0937","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1018","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1019","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1055","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1250","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1253","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1306","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1607","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1612","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1614","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2093","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2394","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2621","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2697","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4577","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4729","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4731","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6546","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2255498","https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3c4f8333b582487a2d1e02171f1465531cde53e3","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-CAN-20527"]}
