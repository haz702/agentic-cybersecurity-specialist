{"id":"CVE-2020-36727","publishedDate":"2023-06-07T02:15:12.673","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Newsletter Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to insecure deserialization in versions up to, and including, 1.5.1. This is due to unsanitized input from the 'customFieldsDetails' parameter being passed through a deserialization function. This potentially makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a serialized PHP object.","references":["https://blog.nintechnet.com/insecure-deserialization-vulnerability-in-wordpress-newsletter-manager-plugin-unpatched/","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/b82124b1-e5e1-4f1e-9513-90474fd3f066","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/dcfd8c4d-d48b-468d-a7d5-1ec05b068f79?source=cve","https://blog.nintechnet.com/insecure-deserialization-vulnerability-in-wordpress-newsletter-manager-plugin-unpatched/","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/b82124b1-e5e1-4f1e-9513-90474fd3f066","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/dcfd8c4d-d48b-468d-a7d5-1ec05b068f79?source=cve"]}
