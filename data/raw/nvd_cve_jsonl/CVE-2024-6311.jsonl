This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/funnelforms-free/tags/3.7.3.2/admin/menu_ajax_functions/formularbuilder_fonts.php#L47","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/funnelforms-free/tags/3.7.4.1/admin/menu_ajax_functions/formularbuilder_fonts.php?rev=3141470#L50","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/cbd42fc4-ab4a-4053-b765-18272eacd2bc?source=cve"]}
