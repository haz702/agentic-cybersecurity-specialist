{"id":"CVE-2023-2904","publishedDate":"2023-06-07T22:15:09.963","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"The External Visitor Manager portal of HID\u2019s SAFE versions 5.8.0 through 5.11.3 are vulnerable to manipulation within web fields in the application programmable interface (API). An attacker could log in using account credentials available through a request generated by an internal user and then manipulate the visitor-id within the web API to access the personal data of other users. There is no limit on the number of requests that can be made to the HID SAFE Web Server, so an attacker could also exploit this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition.\n\n","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-152-02","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-152-02"]}
