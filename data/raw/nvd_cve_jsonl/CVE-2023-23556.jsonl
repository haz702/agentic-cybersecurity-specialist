{"id":"CVE-2023-23556","publishedDate":"2023-05-18T22:15:09.487","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"An error in BigInt conversion to Number in Hermes prior to commit a6dcafe6ded8e61658b40f5699878cd19a481f80 could have been used by a malicious attacker to execute arbitrary code due to an out-of-bound write. Note that this bug is only exploitable in cases where Hermes is used to execute untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.","references":["https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/a6dcafe6ded8e61658b40f5699878cd19a481f80","https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2023-23556","https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/a6dcafe6ded8e61658b40f5699878cd19a481f80","https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2023-23556"]}
