{"id":"CVE-2024-6409","publishedDate":"2024-07-08T18:15:09.487","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4457","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4613","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4716","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4910","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4955","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4960","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5444","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-6409","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2295085","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/08/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/09/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/09/5","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/10/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/10/2","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4457","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4613","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4716","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-6409","https://almalinux.org/blog/2024-07-09-cve-2024-6409/","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2295085","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1227217","https://explore.alas.aws.amazon.com/CVE-2024-6409.html","https://github.com/openela-main/openssh/commit/c00da7741d42029e49047dd89e266d91dcfbffa0","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-6409","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240712-0003/","https://sig-security.rocky.page/issues/CVE-2024-6409/","https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-6409","https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-6409.html"]}
