{"id":"CVE-2024-30264","publishedDate":"2024-04-04T21:15:16.380","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"Typebot is an open-source chatbot builder. A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the sign-in page of typebot.io prior to version 2.24.0 may allow an attacker to hijack a user's account. The sign-in page takes the `redirectPath` parameter from the URL. If a user clicks on a link where the `redirectPath` parameter has a javascript scheme, the attacker that crafted the link may be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the privileges  of the user. Version 2.24.0 contains a patch for this issue.","references":["https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/blob/v2.23.0/apps/builder/src/features/auth/components/SignInForm.tsx#L35","https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/commit/d0be29e25732c410b561cbc3c5607c3c1d4b6c8e","https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/security/advisories/GHSA-mx2f-9mcr-8j73","https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/blob/v2.23.0/apps/builder/src/features/auth/components/SignInForm.tsx#L35","https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/commit/d0be29e25732c410b561cbc3c5607c3c1d4b6c8e","https://github.com/baptisteArno/typebot.io/security/advisories/GHSA-mx2f-9mcr-8j73"]}
