{"id":"CVE-2024-1505","publishedDate":"2024-03-13T16:15:23.893","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Academy LMS \u2013 eLearning and online course solution for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.19. This is due to plugin allowing arbitrary user meta updates through the saved_user_info() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as students, to elevate their user role to that of an administrator.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3037880/academy#file473","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b150f90a-ccb7-4c19-a4b3-eaf9ec264ba8?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3037880/academy#file473","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b150f90a-ccb7-4c19-a4b3-eaf9ec264ba8?source=cve"]}
