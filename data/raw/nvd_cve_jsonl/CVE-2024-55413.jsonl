This can be exploited for privilege escalation, code execution under high privileges, and information disclosure. These signed drivers can also be used to bypass the Microsoft driver-signing policy to deploy malicious code.","references":["https://github.com/heyheysky/vulnerable-driver/blob/master/CVE-2024-55413/CVE-2024-55413_snxppamd.sys_README.md","https://www.sunix.com/tw/"]}
