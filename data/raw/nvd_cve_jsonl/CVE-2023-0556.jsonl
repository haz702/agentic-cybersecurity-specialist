{"id":"CVE-2023-0556","publishedDate":"2023-01-27T22:15:09.147","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The ContentStudio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions in versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain the blog metadata (via the function cstu_get_metadata) that includes the plugin's contentstudio_token. Knowing this token allows for other interactions with the plugin such as creating posts in versions prior to 1.2.5, which added other requirements to posting and updating.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/contentstudio/tags/1.2.1/contentstudio-plugin.php#L517","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=2851006%40contentstudio%2Ftrunk&old=2844028%40contentstudio%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/52db8d41-859a-4d68-8b83-3d3af8f1bf64","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/contentstudio/tags/1.2.1/contentstudio-plugin.php#L517","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=2851006%40contentstudio%2Ftrunk&old=2844028%40contentstudio%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/52db8d41-859a-4d68-8b83-3d3af8f1bf64"]}
