{"id":"CVE-2024-52007","publishedDate":"2024-11-08T23:15:04.757","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"HAPI FHIR is a complete implementation of the HL7 FHIR standard for healthcare interoperability in Java. XSLT parsing performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag ( <!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY example SYSTEM \"/etc/passwd\"> ]> could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.core is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. This is related to GHSA-6cr6-ph3p-f5rf, in which its fix (#1571 & #1717) was incomplete. This issue has been addressed in release version 6.4.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","references":["https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#jaxp-documentbuilderfactory-saxparserfactory-and-dom4j","https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html","https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/issues/1571","https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/pull/1717","https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/security/advisories/GHSA-6cr6-ph3p-f5rf","https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/security/advisories/GHSA-gr3c-q7xf-47vh"]}
