{"id":"CVE-2023-32232","publishedDate":"2023-07-25T01:15:09.177","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"An issue was discovered in Vasion PrinterLogic Client for Windows before 25.0.0.836. During client installation and repair, a PrinterLogic binary is called by the installer to configure the device. This window is not hidden, and is running with elevated privileges. A standard user can break out of this window, obtaining a full SYSTEM command prompt window. This results in complete compromise via arbitrary SYSTEM code execution (elevation of privileges).","references":["https://docs.printercloud.com/1-Printerlogic/Release_Notes/Client_Release_Notes.htm","https://docs.printercloud.com/1-Printerlogic/Release_Notes/Security_Bulletin_CVE.htm","https://www.vasion.com/press-releases/printerlogic-rebrands","https://docs.printercloud.com/1-Printerlogic/Release_Notes/Client_Release_Notes.htm","https://docs.printercloud.com/1-Printerlogic/Release_Notes/Security_Bulletin_CVE.htm","https://www.vasion.com/press-releases/printerlogic-rebrands"]}
