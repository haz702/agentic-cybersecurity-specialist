{"id":"CVE-2024-47619","publishedDate":"2025-05-07T16:15:21.980","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"syslog-ng is an enhanced log daemo. Prior to version 4.8.2, `tls_wildcard_match()` matches on certificates such as `foo.*.bar` although that is not allowed. It is also possible to pass partial wildcards such as `foo.a*c.bar` which glib matches but should be avoided / invalidated. This issue could have an impact on TLS connections, such as in man-in-the-middle situations. Version 4.8.2 contains a fix for the issue.","references":["https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/blob/b0ccc8952d333fbc2d97e51fddc0b569a15e7a7d/lib/transport/tls-verifier.c#L78-L110","https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/commit/dadfdbecde5bfe710b0a6ee5699f96926b3f9006","https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/releases/tag/syslog-ng-4.8.2","https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-xr54-gx74-fghg","https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-xr54-gx74-fghg"]}
