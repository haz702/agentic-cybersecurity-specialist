{"id":"CVE-2024-7656","publishedDate":"2024-08-24T12:15:04.330","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Image Hotspot by DevVN plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.5 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'devvn_ihotspot_shortcode_func' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/devvn-image-hotspot/trunk/admin/inc/add_shortcode_devvn_ihotspot.php#L16","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3139899/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/624bdb9e-6c50-4a00-9a04-1a32c938d48b?source=cve"]}
