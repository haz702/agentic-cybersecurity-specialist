{"id":"CVE-2022-29957","publishedDate":"2022-07-26T22:15:10.923","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"The Emerson DeltaV Distributed Control System (DCS) through 2022-04-29 mishandles authentication. It utilizes several proprietary protocols for a wide variety of functionality. These protocols include Firmware upgrade (18508/TCP, 18518/TCP); Plug-and-Play (18510/UDP); Hawk services (18507/UDP); Management (18519/TCP); Cold restart (18512/UDP); SIS communications (12345/TCP); and Wireless Gateway Protocol (18515/UDP). None of these protocols have any authentication features, allowing any attacker capable of communicating with the ports in question to invoke (a subset of) desired functionality.","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-181-03","https://www.forescout.com/blog/","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-181-03","https://www.forescout.com/blog/"]}
