{"id":"CVE-2021-33898","publishedDate":"2021-06-06T23:15:07.517","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"In Invoice Ninja before 4.4.0, there is an unsafe call to unserialize() in app/Ninja/Repositories/AccountRepository.php that may allow an attacker to deserialize arbitrary PHP classes. In certain contexts, this can result in remote code execution. The attacker's input must be hosted at http://www.geoplugin.net (cleartext HTTP), and thus a successful attack requires spoofing that site or obtaining control of it.","references":["https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/issues/5909","https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/issues/5909"]}
