{"id":"CVE-2025-21811","publishedDate":"2025-02-27T20:16:03.680","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: protect access to buffers with no active references\n\nnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers(), which iterates through the buffers\nattached to dirty data folios/pages, accesses the attached buffers without\nlocking the folios/pages.\n\nFor data cache, nilfs_clear_folio_dirty() may be called asynchronously\nwhen the file system degenerates to read only, so\nnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() still has the potential to cause use\nafter free issues when buffers lose the protection of their dirty state\nmidway due to this asynchronous clearing and are unintentionally freed by\ntry_to_free_buffers().\n\nEliminate this race issue by adjusting the lock section in this function.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/367a9bffabe08c04f6d725032cce3d891b2b9e1a","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b08d23d7d1917bef4fbee8ad81372f49b006656","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/58c27fa7a610b6e8d44e6220e7dbddfbaccaf439","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/72cf688d0ce7e642b12ddc9b2a42524737ec1b4a","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8e1b9201c9a24638cf09c6e1c9f224157328010b","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c437dfac9f7a5a46ac2a5e6d6acd3059e9f68188","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d8ff250e085a4c4cdda4ad1cdd234ed110393143","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1fc4a90a90ea8514246c45435662531975937d9"]}
