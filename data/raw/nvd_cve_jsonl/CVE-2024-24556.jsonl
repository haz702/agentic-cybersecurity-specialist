{"id":"CVE-2024-24556","publishedDate":"2024-01-30T18:15:48.507","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"urql is a GraphQL client that exposes a set of helpers for several frameworks.  The `@urql/next` package is vulnerable to XSS. To exploit this an attacker would need to ensure that the response returns `html` tags and that the web-application is using streamed responses (non-RSC). This vulnerability is due to improper escaping of html-like characters in the response-stream. To fix this vulnerability upgrade to version 1.1.1","references":["https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/commit/4b7011b70d5718728ff912d02a4dbdc7f703540d","https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/security/advisories/GHSA-qhjf-hm5j-335w","https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/commit/4b7011b70d5718728ff912d02a4dbdc7f703540d","https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/security/advisories/GHSA-qhjf-hm5j-335w"]}
