{"id":"CVE-2024-50074","publishedDate":"2024-10-29T01:15:04.540","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nparport: Proper fix for array out-of-bounds access\n\nThe recent fix for array out-of-bounds accesses replaced sprintf()\ncalls blindly with snprintf().  However, since snprintf() returns the\nwould-be-printed size, not the actually output size, the length\ncalculation can still go over the given limit.\n\nUse scnprintf() instead of snprintf(), which returns the actually\noutput letters, for addressing the potential out-of-bounds access\nproperly.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/02ac3a9ef3a18b58d8f3ea2b6e46de657bf6c4f9","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1826b6d69bbb7f9ae8711827facbb2ad7f8d0aaa","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2a8b26a09c8e3ea03da1ef3cd0ef6b96e559fba6","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/440311903231c6e6c9bcf8acb6a2885a422e00bc","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/66029078fee00646e2e9dbb8f41ff7819f8e7569","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8aadef73ba3b325704ed5cfc4696a25c350182cf","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b0641e53e6cb937487b6cfb15772374f0ba149b3","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fca048f222ce9dcbde5708ba2bf81d85a4a27952"]}
