{"id":"CVE-2025-3812","publishedDate":"2025-05-17T06:15:18.660","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The WPBot Pro Wordpress Chatbot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the qcld_openai_delete_training_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 13.6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).","references":["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8fe1609d-17d6-4afe-90b2-5473dc9b6c3b?source=cve","https://www.wpbot.pro/"]}
