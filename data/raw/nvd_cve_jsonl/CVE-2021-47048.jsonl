{"id":"CVE-2021-47048","publishedDate":"2024-02-28T09:15:40.370","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix use-after-free in zynqmp_qspi_exec_op\n\nWhen handling op->addr, it is using the buffer \"tmpbuf\" which has been\nfreed. This will trigger a use-after-free KASAN warning. Let's use\ntemporary variables to store op->addr.val and op->cmd.opcode to fix\nthis issue.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1231279389b5e638bc3b66b9741c94077aed4b5a","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23269ac9f123eca3aea7682d3345c02e71ed696c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2c5bedb2d55dd27c642c7b9fb6886d7ad7bdb58","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d67e0d6bd92ebbb0294e7062bbf5cdc773764e62","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1231279389b5e638bc3b66b9741c94077aed4b5a","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23269ac9f123eca3aea7682d3345c02e71ed696c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a2c5bedb2d55dd27c642c7b9fb6886d7ad7bdb58","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d67e0d6bd92ebbb0294e7062bbf5cdc773764e62"]}
