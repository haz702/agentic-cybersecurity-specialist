This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/enable-shortcodes-inside-widgetscomments-and-experts/trunk/enable-shortcodes-inside-widgets-comments-experts.php#L19","https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-shortcodes-inside-widgetscomments-and-experts/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f1ac2544-f96b-4859-96de-795753a94264?source=cve"]}
