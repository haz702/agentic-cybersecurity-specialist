{"id":"CVE-2021-42523","publishedDate":"2022-08-25T18:15:09.260","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"There are two Information Disclosure vulnerabilities in colord, and they lie in colord/src/cd-device-db.c and colord/src/cd-profile-db.c separately. They exist because the 'err_msg' of 'sqlite3_exec' is not releasing after use, while libxml2 emphasizes that the caller needs to release it.","references":["https://github.com/hughsie/colord/issues/110","https://github.com/hughsie/colord/issues/110"]}
