A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the gst_matroska_demux_parse_blockgroup_or_simpleblock function within matroska-demux.c. This function does not properly check the validity of the GstBuffer *sub pointer before performing dereferences. As a result, null pointer dereferences may occur. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8057.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0020.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-249_Gstreamer/"]}
