{"id":"CVE-2021-3491","publishedDate":"2021-06-04T02:15:07.253","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"The io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed the MAX_RW_COUNT limit to be bypassed in the PROVIDE_BUFFERS operation, which led to negative values being usedin mem_rw when reading /proc/<PID>/mem. This could be used to create a heap overflow leading to arbitrary code execution in the kernel. It was addressed via commit d1f82808877b (\"io_uring: truncate lengths larger than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide buffers\") (v5.13-rc1) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was introduced in ddf0322db79c (\"io_uring: add IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS\") (v5.7-rc1).","references":["https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d1f82808877bb10d3deee7cf3374a4eb3fb582db","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210716-0004/","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4949-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4950-1","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/11/13","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-589/","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d1f82808877bb10d3deee7cf3374a4eb3fb582db","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210716-0004/","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4949-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4950-1","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/11/13","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-589/"]}
