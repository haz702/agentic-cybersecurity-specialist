Prior to versions 3.1.45 and 4.1.1, template authors could inject php code by choosing a malicious {block} name or {include} file name. Sites that cannot fully trust template authors should upgrade to versions 3.1.45 or 4.1.1 to receive a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.","references":["https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/commit/64ad6442ca1da31cefdab5c9874262b702cccddd","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/releases/tag/v3.1.45","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/releases/tag/v4.1.1","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/security/advisories/GHSA-634x-pc3q-cf4c","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00044.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BRAJVDRGCIY5UZ2PQHKDTT7RMKG6WJQQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L777JIBIWJV34HS7LXPIDWASG7TT4LNI/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-09","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5151","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/commit/64ad6442ca1da31cefdab5c9874262b702cccddd","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/releases/tag/v3.1.45","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/releases/tag/v4.1.1","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/security/advisories/GHSA-634x-pc3q-cf4c","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00044.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BRAJVDRGCIY5UZ2PQHKDTT7RMKG6WJQQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L777JIBIWJV34HS7LXPIDWASG7TT4LNI/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-09","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5151"]}
