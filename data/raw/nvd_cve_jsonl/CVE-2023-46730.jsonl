{"id":"CVE-2023-46730","publishedDate":"2023-11-07T18:15:08.973","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"Group-Office is an enterprise CRM and groupware tool. In affected versions there is full Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /api/upload.php endpoint. The /api/upload.php endpoint does not filter URLs which allows a malicious user to cause the server to make resource requests to untrusted domains. Note that protocols like file:// can also be used to access the server disk. The request result (on success) can then be retrieved using /api/download.php. This issue has been addressed in versions 6.8.15, 6.7.54, and 6.6.177. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","references":["https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/commit/99205535e8cec6592fd7f1469837926f27c72d50","https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/security/advisories/GHSA-vw6c-h82w-mvfv","https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/commit/99205535e8cec6592fd7f1469837926f27c72d50","https://github.com/Intermesh/groupoffice/security/advisories/GHSA-vw6c-h82w-mvfv"]}
