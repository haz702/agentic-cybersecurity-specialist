{"id":"CVE-2024-13869","publishedDate":"2025-02-22T13:15:10.920","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The Migration, Backup, Staging \u2013 WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'upload_files' function in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.112. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: Uploaded files are only accessible on WordPress instances running on the NGINX web server as the existing .htaccess within the target file upload folder prevents access on Apache servers.","references":["https://github.com/d0n601/CVE-2024-13869","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3242904/wpvivid-backuprestore","https://ryankozak.com/posts/cve-2024-13869/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0082e46d-fdbe-4ab7-bba3-0681a25d4495?source=cve"]}
