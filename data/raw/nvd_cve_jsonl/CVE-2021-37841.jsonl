{"id":"CVE-2021-37841","publishedDate":"2021-08-12T14:15:07.010","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Docker Desktop before 3.6.0 suffers from incorrect access control. If a low-privileged account is able to access the server running the Windows containers, it can lead to a full container compromise in both process isolation and Hyper-V isolation modes. This security issue leads an attacker with low privilege to read, write and possibly even execute code inside the containers.","references":["https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/","https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/release-notes/"]}
