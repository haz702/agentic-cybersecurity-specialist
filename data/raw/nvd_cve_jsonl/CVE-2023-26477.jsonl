{"id":"CVE-2023-26477","publishedDate":"2023-03-02T18:15:10.293","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in versions 6.3-rc-1 and 6.2.4, it's possible to inject arbitrary wiki syntax including Groovy, Python and Velocity script macros via the `newThemeName` request parameter (URL parameter), in combination with additional parameters. This has been patched in the supported versions 13.10.10, 14.9-rc-1, and 14.4.6. As a workaround, it is possible to edit `FlamingoThemesCode.WebHomeSheet` and manually perform the changes from the patch fixing the issue.\n","references":["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/ea2e615f50a918802fd60b09ec87aa04bc6ea8e2#diff-e2153fa59f9d92ef67b0afbf27984bd17170921a3b558fac227160003d0dfd2aR283-R284","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-x2qm-r4wx-8gpg","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19757","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/ea2e615f50a918802fd60b09ec87aa04bc6ea8e2#diff-e2153fa59f9d92ef67b0afbf27984bd17170921a3b558fac227160003d0dfd2aR283-R284","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-x2qm-r4wx-8gpg","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19757"]}
