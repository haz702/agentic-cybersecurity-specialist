{"id":"CVE-2023-4916","publishedDate":"2023-09-13T03:15:09.343","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.6. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'lwp_update_password_action' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user password via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/login-with-phone-number/trunk/login-with-phonenumber.php?rev=2965324#L2942","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/login-with-phone-number/trunk/login-with-phonenumber.php?rev=2967707#L2948","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/71083db7-377b-47a1-ac8b-83d8974a2654?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/login-with-phone-number/trunk/login-with-phonenumber.php?rev=2965324#L2942","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/login-with-phone-number/trunk/login-with-phonenumber.php?rev=2967707#L2948","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/71083db7-377b-47a1-ac8b-83d8974a2654?source=cve"]}
