{"id":"CVE-2022-1227","publishedDate":"2022-04-29T16:15:08.753","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A privilege escalation flaw was found in Podman. This flaw allows an attacker to publish a malicious image to a public registry. Once this image is downloaded by a potential victim, the vulnerability is triggered after a user runs the 'podman top' command. This action gives the attacker access to the host filesystem, leading to information disclosure or denial of service.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2070368","https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10941","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DLUJZV3HBP56ADXU6QH2V7RNYUPMVBXQ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240628-0001/","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2070368","https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10941","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DLUJZV3HBP56ADXU6QH2V7RNYUPMVBXQ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240628-0001/"]}
