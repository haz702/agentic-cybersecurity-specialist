{"id":"CVE-2022-21680","publishedDate":"2022-01-14T17:15:13.210","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `block.def` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.","references":["https://github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/c4a3ccd344b6929afa8a1d50ac54a721e57012c0","https://github.com/markedjs/marked/releases/tag/v4.0.10","https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-rrrm-qjm4-v8hf","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AIXDMC3CSHYW3YWVSQOXAWLUYQHAO5UX/","https://github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/c4a3ccd344b6929afa8a1d50ac54a721e57012c0","https://github.com/markedjs/marked/releases/tag/v4.0.10","https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-rrrm-qjm4-v8hf","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AIXDMC3CSHYW3YWVSQOXAWLUYQHAO5UX/"]}
