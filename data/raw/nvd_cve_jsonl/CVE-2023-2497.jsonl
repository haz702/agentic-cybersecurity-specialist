{"id":"CVE-2023-2497","publishedDate":"2023-11-22T16:15:08.857","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The UserPro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 5.1.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'import_settings' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to exploit PHP Object Injection due to the use of unserialize() on the user supplied parameter via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://codecanyon.net/item/userpro-user-profiles-with-social-login/5958681","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fbb601ce-a884-4894-af13-dab14885c7eb?source=cve","https://codecanyon.net/item/userpro-user-profiles-with-social-login/5958681","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fbb601ce-a884-4894-af13-dab14885c7eb?source=cve"]}
