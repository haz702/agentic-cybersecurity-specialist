The openshift.io/cluster-monitoring label is applied to all namespaces that deploy an ArgoCD CR instance, allowing the namespace to create a rogue PrometheusRule. This issue can have adverse effects on the platform monitoring stack, as the rule is rolled out cluster-wide when the label is applied.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7753","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-13484","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2269376"]}
