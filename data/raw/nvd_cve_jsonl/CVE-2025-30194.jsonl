{"id":"CVE-2025-30194","publishedDate":"2025-04-29T12:15:31.983","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"When DNSdist is configured to provide DoH via the nghttp2 provider, an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a DoH exchange that triggers an illegal memory access (double-free) and crash of DNSdist, causing a denial of service.\n\nThe remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.9 version.\n\nA workaround is to temporarily switch to the h2o provider until DNSdist has been upgraded to a fixed version.\n\nWe would like to thank Charles Howes for bringing this issue to our attention.","references":["https://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2025-02.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/29/1"]}
