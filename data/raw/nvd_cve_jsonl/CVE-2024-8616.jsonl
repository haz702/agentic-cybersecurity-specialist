{"id":"CVE-2024-8616","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:43.590","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"In h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0, the `/99/Models/{name}/json` endpoint allows for arbitrary file overwrite on the target server. The vulnerability arises from the `exportModelDetails` function in `ModelsHandler.java`, where the user-controllable `mexport.dir` parameter is used to specify the file path for writing model details. This can lead to overwriting files at arbitrary locations on the host system.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/aebf69a5-b9b1-4d2f-a8ff-902c11a8c97a"]}
