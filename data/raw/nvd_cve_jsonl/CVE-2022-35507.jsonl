{"id":"CVE-2022-35507","publishedDate":"2022-12-04T19:15:09.850","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS. This affects Chromium-based browsers because they allow injection of response headers with %0d. This is fixed in pve-http-server 4.1-3.","references":["https://git.proxmox.com/?p=pve-http-server.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=936007ae0241811093155000486da171379c23c2","https://starlabs.sg/blog/2022/12-multiple-vulnerabilites-in-proxmox-ve--proxmox-mail-gateway/","https://git.proxmox.com/?p=pve-http-server.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=936007ae0241811093155000486da171379c23c2","https://starlabs.sg/blog/2022/12-multiple-vulnerabilites-in-proxmox-ve--proxmox-mail-gateway/"]}
