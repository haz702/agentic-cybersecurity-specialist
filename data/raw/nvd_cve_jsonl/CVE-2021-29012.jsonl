{"id":"CVE-2021-29012","publishedDate":"2021-04-02T13:15:11.873","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"DMA Softlab Radius Manager 4.4.0 assigns the same session cookie to every admin session. The cookie is valid when the admin is logged in, but is invalid (temporarily) during times when the admin is logged out. In other words, the cookie is functionally equivalent to a static password, and thus provides permanent access if stolen.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/164154/DMA-Softlab-Radius-Manager-4.4.0-Session-Management-Cross-Site-Scripting.html","https://github.com/1d8/publications/tree/main/cve-2021-29012","https://sourceforge.net/projects/radiusmanager/","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/164154/DMA-Softlab-Radius-Manager-4.4.0-Session-Management-Cross-Site-Scripting.html","https://github.com/1d8/publications/tree/main/cve-2021-29012","https://sourceforge.net/projects/radiusmanager/"]}
