{"id":"CVE-2021-20235","publishedDate":"2021-04-01T14:15:13.217","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"There's a flaw in the zeromq server in versions before 4.3.3 in src/decoder_allocators.hpp. The decoder static allocator could have its sized changed, but the buffer would remain the same as it is a static buffer. A remote, unauthenticated attacker who sends a crafted request to the zeromq server could trigger a buffer overflow WRITE of arbitrary data if CURVE/ZAP authentication is not enabled. The greatest impact of this flaw is to application availability, data integrity, and confidentiality.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1921983","https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1921983","https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6"]}
