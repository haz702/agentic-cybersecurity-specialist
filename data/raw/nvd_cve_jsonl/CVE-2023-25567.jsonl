{"id":"CVE-2023-25567","publishedDate":"2023-02-14T18:15:13.487","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"GSS-NTLMSSP, a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM authentication, has an out-of-bounds read when decoding target information prior to version 1.2.0. The length of the `av_pair` is not checked properly for two of the elements which can trigger an out-of-bound read. The out-of-bounds read can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point and could cause a denial-of-service if the memory is unmapped. The issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.","references":["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/025fbb756d44ffee8f847db4222ed6aa4bd1fbe4","https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0","https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-24pf-6prf-24ch","https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/025fbb756d44ffee8f847db4222ed6aa4bd1fbe4","https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0","https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-24pf-6prf-24ch"]}
