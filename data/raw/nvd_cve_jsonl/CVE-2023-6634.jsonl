{"id":"CVE-2023-6634","publishedDate":"2024-01-11T09:15:50.437","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The LearnPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Command Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.5.7 via the get_content function. This is due to the plugin making use of the call_user_func function with user input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute any public function with one parameter, which could result in remote code execution.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3013957/learnpress","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/21291ed7-cdc0-4698-9ec4-8417160845ed?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3013957/learnpress","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/21291ed7-cdc0-4698-9ec4-8417160845ed?source=cve"]}
