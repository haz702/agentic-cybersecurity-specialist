{"id":"CVE-2021-39187","publishedDate":"2021-09-02T16:15:07.540","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist.","references":["https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/308668c89474223e2448be92d6823b52c1c313ec","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/4.10.3","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-xqp8-w826-hh6x","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3463","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/308668c89474223e2448be92d6823b52c1c313ec","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/4.10.3","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-xqp8-w826-hh6x","https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3463"]}
