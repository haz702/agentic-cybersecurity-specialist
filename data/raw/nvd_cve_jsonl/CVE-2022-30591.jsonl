{"id":"CVE-2022-30591","publishedDate":"2022-07-06T12:15:08.173","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"quic-go through 0.27.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a Slowloris variant in which incomplete QUIC or HTTP/3 requests are sent. This occurs because mtu_discoverer.go misparses the MTU Discovery service and consequently overflows the probe timer. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this behavior should not be listed as a vulnerability on the CVE List","references":["https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/blob/84e03e59760ceee37359688871bb0688fcc4e98f/mtu_discoverer.go","https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/blob/84e03e59760ceee37359688871bb0688fcc4e98f/mtu_discoverer.go"]}
