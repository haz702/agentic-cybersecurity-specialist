{"id":"CVE-2022-49076","publishedDate":"2025-02-26T07:00:44.943","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hfi1: Fix use-after-free bug for mm struct\n\nUnder certain conditions, such as MPI_Abort, the hfi1 cleanup code may\nrepresent the last reference held on the task mm.\nhfi1_mmu_rb_unregister() then drops the last reference and the mm is freed\nbefore the final use in hfi1_release_user_pages().  A new task may\nallocate the mm structure while it is still being used, resulting in\nproblems. One manifestation is corruption of the mmap_sem counter leading\nto a hang in down_write().  Another is corruption of an mm struct that is\nin use by another task.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0b7186d657ee55e2cdefae498f07d5c1961e8023","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2bbac98d0930e8161b1957dc0ec99de39ade1b3c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5a9a1b24ddb510715f8f621263938186579a965c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f54364ff6cfcd14cddf5441c4a490bb28dd69f7","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9ca11bd8222a612de0d2f54d050bfcf61ae2883f"]}
