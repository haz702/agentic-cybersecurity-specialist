The filename is used even if it has been created by a local adversary before Cadence started. The adversary can leverage this to create or overwrite files via a symlink attack. In some kernel configurations, code injection into the Wine registry is possible.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/05/4","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1213985","https://github.com/falkTX/Cadence","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/05/4","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1213985","https://github.com/falkTX/Cadence"]}
