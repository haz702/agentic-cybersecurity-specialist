{"id":"CVE-2024-8061","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:40.500","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In version 3.23.0 of aimhubio/aim, certain methods that request data from external servers do not have set timeouts, causing the server to wait indefinitely for a response. This can lead to a denial of service, as the tracking server does not respond to other requests while waiting. The issue arises in the client used by the `aim` tracking server to communicate with external resources, specifically in the `_run_read_instructions` method and similar calls without timeouts.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/c85d005c-b354-4c51-a88f-adda2f09622b"]}
