{"id":"CVE-2025-32433","publishedDate":"2025-04-16T22:15:14.373","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20. A temporary workaround involves disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules.","references":["https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/0fcd9c56524b28615e8ece65fc0c3f66ef6e4c12","https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/6eef04130afc8b0ccb63c9a0d8650209cf54892f","https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/b1924d37fd83c070055beb115d5d6a6a9490b891","https://github.com/erlang/otp/security/advisories/GHSA-37cp-fgq5-7wc2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/16/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/18/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/18/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/18/6","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/19/1","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250425-0001/","https://github.com/ProDefense/CVE-2025-32433/blob/main/CVE-2025-32433.py"]}
