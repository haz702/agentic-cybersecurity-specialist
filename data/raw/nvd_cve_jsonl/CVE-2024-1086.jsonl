{"id":"CVE-2024-1086","publishedDate":"2024-01-31T13:15:10.827","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter: nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nThe nft_verdict_init() function allows positive values as drop error within the hook verdict, and hence the nf_hook_slow() function can cause a double free vulnerability when NF_DROP is issued with a drop error which resembles NF_ACCEPT.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit f342de4e2f33e0e39165d8639387aa6c19dff660.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/10/22","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/10/23","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/14/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/17/5","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f342de4e2f33e0e39165d8639387aa6c19dff660","https://github.com/Notselwyn/CVE-2024-1086","https://kernel.dance/f342de4e2f33e0e39165d8639387aa6c19dff660","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00016.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00020.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7LSPIOMIJYTLZB6QKPQVVAYSUETUWKPF/","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39828424","https://pwning.tech/nftables/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240614-0009/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/10/22","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/10/23","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/14/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/15/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/17/5","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f342de4e2f33e0e39165d8639387aa6c19dff660","https://github.com/Notselwyn/CVE-2024-1086","https://kernel.dance/f342de4e2f33e0e39165d8639387aa6c19dff660","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00016.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00020.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7LSPIOMIJYTLZB6QKPQVVAYSUETUWKPF/","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39828424","https://pwning.tech/nftables/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240614-0009/"]}
