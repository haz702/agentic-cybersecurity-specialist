This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.","references":["https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-ultimate-gift-card/19191057","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6ebffb82-7455-40c9-9ffd-b78e0e73e431?source=cve"]}
