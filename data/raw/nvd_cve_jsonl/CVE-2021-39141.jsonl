{"id":"CVE-2021-39141","publishedDate":"2021-08-23T18:15:12.010","cvssV3":8.5,"description":"XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.","references":["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-g5w6-mrj7-75h2","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22KVR6B5IZP3BGQ3HPWIO2FWWCKT3DHP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PVPHZA7VW2RRSDCOIPP2W6O5ND254TU7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGXIU3YDPG6OGTDHMBLAFN7BPBERXREB/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210923-0003/","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5004","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39141.html","https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-g5w6-mrj7-75h2","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22KVR6B5IZP3BGQ3HPWIO2FWWCKT3DHP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PVPHZA7VW2RRSDCOIPP2W6O5ND254TU7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGXIU3YDPG6OGTDHMBLAFN7BPBERXREB/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210923-0003/","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5004","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39141.html"]}
