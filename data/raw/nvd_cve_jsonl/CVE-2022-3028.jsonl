{"id":"CVE-2022-3028","publishedDate":"2022-08-31T16:15:11.867","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's IP framework for transforming packets (XFRM subsystem) when multiple calls to xfrm_probe_algs occurred simultaneously. This flaw could allow a local attacker to potentially trigger an out-of-bounds write or leak kernel heap memory by performing an out-of-bounds read and copying it into a socket.","references":["https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/ba953a9d89a00c078b85f4b190bc1dde66fe16b5","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00000.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00001.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F3MYP7WX4PNE6RCITVXA43CECBZT4CL6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JKVA75UHKVOHNOEPCLUHTFGWCOOUBDM3/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PEQYVCNYUWB4CJ2YRAYNF2GGFQ7SUYC4/","https://lore.kernel.org/all/YtoWqEkKzvimzWS5%40gondor.apana.org.au/T/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230214-0004/","https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/ba953a9d89a00c078b85f4b190bc1dde66fe16b5","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00000.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00001.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F3MYP7WX4PNE6RCITVXA43CECBZT4CL6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JKVA75UHKVOHNOEPCLUHTFGWCOOUBDM3/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PEQYVCNYUWB4CJ2YRAYNF2GGFQ7SUYC4/","https://lore.kernel.org/all/YtoWqEkKzvimzWS5%40gondor.apana.org.au/T/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230214-0004/"]}
