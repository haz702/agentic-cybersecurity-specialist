{"id":"CVE-2025-4660","publishedDate":"2025-05-13T18:15:41.843","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows agent component of SecureConnector\u00a0due to improper access controls on a named pipe. The pipe is accessible to the Everyone group and does not restrict remote connections, allowing any network-based attacker to connect without authentication. By interacting with this pipe, an attacker can redirect the agent to communicate with a rogue server that can issue commands via the SecureConnector Agent.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis does not impact Linux or OSX Secure Connector.","references":["https://forescout.my.site.com/support/s/article/"]}
