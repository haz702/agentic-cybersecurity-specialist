{"id":"CVE-2022-24877","publishedDate":"2022-05-06T01:15:09.387","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"Flux is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes. Path Traversal in the kustomize-controller via a malicious `kustomization.yaml` allows an attacker to expose sensitive data from the controller\u2019s pod filesystem and possibly privilege escalation in multi-tenancy deployments. Workarounds include automated tooling in the user's CI/CD pipeline to validate `kustomization.yaml` files conform with specific policies. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0.","references":["https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-j77r-2fxf-5jrw","https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-j77r-2fxf-5jrw"]}
