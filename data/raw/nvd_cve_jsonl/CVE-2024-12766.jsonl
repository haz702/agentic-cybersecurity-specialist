Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to abuse the victim server's credentials to access unauthorized web resources by specifying the JSON parameter `{\"url\":\"http://steal.target\"}`. Existing security mechanisms such as `forbid_remote_access(lollmsElfServer)`, `lollmsElfServer.config.headless_server_mode`, and `check_access(lollmsElfServer, request.client_id)` do not protect against this vulnerability.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/a143a2e2-1293-4dec-b875-3312584bd2b1","https://huntr.com/bounties/a143a2e2-1293-4dec-b875-3312584bd2b1"]}
