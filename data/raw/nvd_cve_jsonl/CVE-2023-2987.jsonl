{"id":"CVE-2023-2987","publishedDate":"2023-05-31T03:15:09.643","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Wordapp plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to an use of insufficiently unique cryptographic signature on the 'wa_pdx_op_config_set' function in versions up to, and including, 1.5.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to the plugin to change the 'validation_token' in the plugin config, providing access to the plugin's remote control functionalities, such as creating an admin access URL, which can be used for privilege escalation.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordapp/trunk/includes/access.php#L28","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordapp/trunk/includes/config.php#L59","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordapp/trunk/includes/pdx.php#L64","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/80440bfa-4a02-4441-bbdb-52d7dd065a9d?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordapp/trunk/includes/access.php#L28","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordapp/trunk/includes/config.php#L59","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordapp/trunk/includes/pdx.php#L64","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/80440bfa-4a02-4441-bbdb-52d7dd065a9d?source=cve"]}
