{"id":"CVE-2024-6983","publishedDate":"2024-09-27T16:15:06.533","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"mudler/localai version 2.17.1 is vulnerable to remote code execution. The vulnerability arises because the localai backend receives inputs not only from the configuration file but also from other inputs, allowing an attacker to upload a binary file and execute malicious code. This can lead to the attacker gaining full control over the system.","references":["https://github.com/mudler/localai/commit/d02a0f6f01d5c4a926a2d67190cb55d7aca23b66","https://huntr.com/bounties/f91fb287-412e-4c89-87df-9e4b6e609647"]}
