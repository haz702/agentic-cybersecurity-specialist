When an administrator later accesses the People Management page, exports the data as a CSV file, and opens it, the injected payload will be executed, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate internal system data from the CSV file to a remote server.","references":["https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Tommywarren/b3a6c6ae5a93dd67c863313f71f53a76/raw/ddff8cbbab5179f680ba3f5e94fc080575ad8913/CVE-2024-51094"]}
