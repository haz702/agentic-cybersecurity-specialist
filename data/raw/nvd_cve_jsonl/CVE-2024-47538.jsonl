{"id":"CVE-2024-47538","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:28.070","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the `vorbis_handle_identification_packet` function within `gstvorbisdec.c`. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd->vi.channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array. The value written will always be `GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE`. This vulnerability allows someone to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally, this bug can overwrite the `GstAudioInfo` info structure. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8035.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0022.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-115_GHSL-2024-118_Gstreamer/"]}
