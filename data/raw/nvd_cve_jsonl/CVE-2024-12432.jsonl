This is due to the 'generate_key' function not producing a sufficiently random value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to log in as site administrators, granted they have triggered the ajax_login() function which generates a unique key that can be used to log in.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3208130%40wpc-shop-as-customer&new=3208130%40wpc-shop-as-customer&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/048625e8-10b7-418d-a13b-329f1d7e0171?source=cve"]}
