{"id":"CVE-2024-32652","publishedDate":"2024-04-19T19:15:07.067","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The adapter @hono/node-server allows you to run your Hono application on Node.js. Prior to 1.10.1, the application hangs when receiving a Host header with a value that `@hono/node-server` can't handle well. Invalid values are those that cannot be parsed by the `URL` as a hostname such as an empty string, slashes `/`, and other strings. The version 1.10.1 includes the fix for this issue.","references":["https://github.com/honojs/node-server/commit/d847e60249fd8183ba0998bc379ba20505643204","https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/159","https://github.com/honojs/node-server/security/advisories/GHSA-hgxw-5xg3-69jx","https://github.com/honojs/node-server/commit/d847e60249fd8183ba0998bc379ba20505643204","https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/159","https://github.com/honojs/node-server/security/advisories/GHSA-hgxw-5xg3-69jx"]}
