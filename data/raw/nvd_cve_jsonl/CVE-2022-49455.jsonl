{"id":"CVE-2022-49455","publishedDate":"2025-02-26T07:01:21.857","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmisc: ocxl: fix possible double free in ocxl_file_register_afu\n\ninfo_release() will be called in device_unregister() when info->dev's\nreference count is 0. So there is no need to call ocxl_afu_put() and\nkfree() again.\n\nFix this by adding free_minor() and return to err_unregister error path.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/252768d32e92c1214aeebb5fec0844ca479bcf5c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8fb674216835e1f0c143762696d645facebb4685","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/950cf957fe34d40d63dfa3bf3968210430b6491e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9e9087cf34ee69f4e95d146ac29385d6e367a97b","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/de65c32ace9aa70d51facc61ba986607075e3a25","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee89d8dee55ab4b3b8ad8b70866b2841ba334767"]}
