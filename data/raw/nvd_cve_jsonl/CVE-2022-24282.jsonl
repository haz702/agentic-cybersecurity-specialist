{"id":"CVE-2022-24282","publishedDate":"2022-03-08T12:15:11.493","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC NMS (All versions >= V1.0.3 < V2.0), SINEC NMS (All versions < V1.0.3), SINEMA Server V14 (All versions). The affected system allows to upload JSON objects that are deserialized to Java objects. Due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software, a privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a maliciously crafted serialized Java object. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges.","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-250085.pdf","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-250085.pdf"]}
