{"id":"CVE-2024-25139","publishedDate":"2024-03-14T16:15:50.077","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"In TP-Link Omada er605 1.0.1 through (v2.6) 2.2.3, a cloud-brd binary is susceptible to an integer overflow that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. After heap shaping, an attacker can achieve code execution in the context of the cloud-brd binary that runs at the root level. This is fixed in ER605(UN)_v2_2.2.4 Build 020240119.","references":["https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-TP-Link-Research-Team","https://www.tp-link.com/us/omada-sdn/","https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-TP-Link-Research-Team","https://www.tp-link.com/us/omada-sdn/"]}
