{"id":"CVE-2022-39356","publishedDate":"2022-11-02T17:15:17.520","cvssV3":8.9,"description":"Discourse is a platform for community discussion. Users who receive an invitation link that is not scoped to a single email address can enter any non-admin user's email and gain access to their account when accepting the invitation. All users should upgrade to the latest version. A workaround is temporarily disabling invitations with `SiteSetting.max_invites_per_day = 0` or scope them to individual email addresses.","references":["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/18817","https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-x8w7-rwmr-w278","https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/18817","https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-x8w7-rwmr-w278"]}
