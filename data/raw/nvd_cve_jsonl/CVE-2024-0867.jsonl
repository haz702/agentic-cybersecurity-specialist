{"id":"CVE-2024-0867","publishedDate":"2024-05-24T06:15:08.380","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The Email Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Hook Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.8 via the check_nonce function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute actions with hooks in WordPress under certain circumstances. The action the attacker wishes to execute needs to have a nonce check, and the nonce needs to be known to the attacker. Furthermore, the absence of a capability check is a requirement.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3027872%40email-log&new=3027872%40email-log&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://wordpress.org/plugins/email-log/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fd15268f-7e06-4e0d-baaf-f27348af61ce?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3027872%40email-log&new=3027872%40email-log&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://wordpress.org/plugins/email-log/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fd15268f-7e06-4e0d-baaf-f27348af61ce?source=cve"]}
