{"id":"CVE-2021-42252","publishedDate":"2021-10-11T19:15:07.713","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in aspeed_lpc_ctrl_mmap in drivers/soc/aspeed/aspeed-lpc-ctrl.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.6. Local attackers able to access the Aspeed LPC control interface could overwrite memory in the kernel and potentially execute privileges, aka CID-b49a0e69a7b1. This occurs because a certain comparison uses values that are not memory sizes.","references":["https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.14.6","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b49a0e69a7b1a68c8d3f64097d06dabb770fec96","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211112-0006/","https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.14.6","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b49a0e69a7b1a68c8d3f64097d06dabb770fec96","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211112-0006/"]}
