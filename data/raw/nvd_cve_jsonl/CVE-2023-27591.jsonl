{"id":"CVE-2023-27591","publishedDate":"2023-03-17T20:15:13.100","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Miniflux is a feed reader. Prior to version 2.0.43, an unauthenticated user can retrieve Prometheus metrics from a publicly reachable Miniflux instance where the `METRICS_COLLECTOR` configuration option is enabled and `METRICS_ALLOWED_NETWORKS` is set to `127.0.0.1/8` (the default). A patch is available in Miniflux 2.0.43. As a workaround, set `METRICS_COLLECTOR` to `false` (default) or run Miniflux behind a trusted reverse-proxy.","references":["https://github.com/miniflux/v2/pull/1745","https://github.com/miniflux/v2/releases/tag/2.0.43","https://github.com/miniflux/v2/security/advisories/GHSA-3qjf-qh38-x73v","https://miniflux.app/docs/configuration.html#metrics-collector","https://github.com/miniflux/v2/pull/1745","https://github.com/miniflux/v2/releases/tag/2.0.43","https://github.com/miniflux/v2/security/advisories/GHSA-3qjf-qh38-x73v","https://miniflux.app/docs/configuration.html#metrics-collector"]}
