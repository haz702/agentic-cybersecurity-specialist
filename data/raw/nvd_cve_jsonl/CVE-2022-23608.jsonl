{"id":"CVE-2022-23608","publishedDate":"2022-02-22T20:15:07.693","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions up to and including 2.11.1 when in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually leading to endless loop. A patch is available in commit db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which will be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166226/Asterisk-Project-Security-Advisory-AST-2022-005.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Mar/1","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-ffff-m5fm-qm62","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00040.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166226/Asterisk-Project-Security-Advisory-AST-2022-005.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Mar/1","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-ffff-m5fm-qm62","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00040.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285"]}
