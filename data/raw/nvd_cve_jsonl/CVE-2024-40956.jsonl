The descriptor is freed via\nidxd_desc_complete() and there's a slight chance may cause issue for\nthe list iterator when the descriptor is reused by another thread\nwithout it being deleted from the list.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1b08bf5a17c66ab7dbb628df5344da53c8e7ab33","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/83163667d881100a485b6c2daa30301b7f68d9b5","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a14968921486793f2a956086895c3793761309dd","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3215deca4520773cd2b155bed164c12365149a7","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/faa35db78b058a2ab6e074ee283f69fa398c36a8","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1b08bf5a17c66ab7dbb628df5344da53c8e7ab33","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/83163667d881100a485b6c2daa30301b7f68d9b5","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a14968921486793f2a956086895c3793761309dd","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3215deca4520773cd2b155bed164c12365149a7","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/faa35db78b058a2ab6e074ee283f69fa398c36a8"]}
