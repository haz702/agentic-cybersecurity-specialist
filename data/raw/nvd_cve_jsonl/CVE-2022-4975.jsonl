{"id":"CVE-2022-4975","publishedDate":"2025-01-27T14:15:27.210","cvssV3":8.9,"description":"A flaw was found in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) portal. When rendering a table view in the portal, for example, on any of the /main/configmanagement/* endpoints, the front-end generates a DOM table-element (id=\"pdf-table\"). This information is then populated with unsanitized data using innerHTML. An attacker with some control over the data rendered can trigger a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-4975","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2071527"]}
