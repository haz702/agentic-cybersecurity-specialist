{"id":"CVE-2021-37933","publishedDate":"2021-10-14T16:15:09.123","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An LDAP injection vulnerability in /account/login in Huntflow Enterprise before 3.10.6 could allow an unauthenticated, remote user to modify the logic of an LDAP query and bypass authentication. The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side validation of the email parameter before using it to construct LDAP queries. An attacker could bypass authentication exploiting this vulnerability by sending login attempts in which there is a valid password but a wildcard character in email parameter.","references":["https://gist.github.com/andrey-lomtev/cbf12bc8d8763996cf8d6d1641a0b049","https://gist.github.com/andrey-lomtev/cbf12bc8d8763996cf8d6d1641a0b049"]}
