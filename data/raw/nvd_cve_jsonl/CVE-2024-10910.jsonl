{"id":"CVE-2024-10910","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T05:15:07.183","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"The The Grid Plus \u2013 Unlimited grid layout plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via grid_plus_load_by_category AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/grid-plus/tags/1.3.5/core/ajax_fe.php#L19","https://wordpress.org/plugins/grid-plus/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/266032a8-a139-4a14-8eda-8be7a66357df?source=cve"]}
