{"id":"CVE-2025-21786","publishedDate":"2025-02-27T03:15:19.450","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nworkqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool\n\nThe commit 68f83057b913(\"workqueue: Reap workers via kthread_stop() and\nremove detach_completion\") adds code to reap the normal workers but\nmistakenly does not handle the rescuer and also removes the code waiting\nfor the rescuer in put_unbound_pool(), which caused a use-after-free bug\nreported by Cheung Wall.\n\nTo avoid the use-after-free bug, the pool\u2019s reference must be held until\nthe detachment is complete. Therefore, move the code that puts the pwq\nafter detaching the rescuer from the pool.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/835b69c868f53f959d4986bbecd561ba6f38e492","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e76946110137703c16423baf6ee177b751a34b7e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e7c16028a424dd35be1064a68fa318be4359310f"]}
