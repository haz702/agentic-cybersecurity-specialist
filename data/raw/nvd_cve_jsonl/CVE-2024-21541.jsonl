{"id":"CVE-2024-21541","publishedDate":"2024-11-13T05:15:14.680","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"Versions of the package dom-iterator before 1.0.1 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to use of the Function constructor without complete input sanitization. Function generates a new function body and thus care must be given to ensure that the inputs to Function are not attacker-controlled. The risks involved are similar to that of allowing attacker-controlled input to reach eval.","references":["https://github.com/matthewmueller/dom-iterator/commit/9e0e0fad5a251de5b42feb326c4204eb04080805","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-8383166","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DOMITERATOR-6157199"]}
