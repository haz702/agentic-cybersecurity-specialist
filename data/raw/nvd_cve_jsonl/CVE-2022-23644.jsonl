{"id":"CVE-2022-23644","publishedDate":"2022-02-16T19:15:09.230","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"BookWyrm is a decentralized social network for tracking reading habits and reviewing books. The functionality to load a cover via url is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery attack. Any BookWyrm instance running a version prior to v0.3.0 is susceptible to attack from a logged-in user. The problem has been patched and administrators should upgrade to version 0.3.0 As a workaround, BookWyrm instances can close registration and limit members to trusted individuals.","references":["https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/security/advisories/GHSA-5m7g-66h6-5cvq","https://github.com/bookwyrm-social/bookwyrm/security/advisories/GHSA-5m7g-66h6-5cvq"]}
