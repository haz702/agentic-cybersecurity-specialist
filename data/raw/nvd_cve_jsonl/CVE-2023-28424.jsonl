{"id":"CVE-2023-28424","publishedDate":"2023-03-20T13:15:11.973","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"Soko if the code that powers packages.gentoo.org. Prior to version 1.0.2, the two package search handlers, `Search` and `SearchFeed`, implemented in `pkg/app/handler/packages/search.go`, are affected by a SQL injection via the `q` parameter. As a result, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on `https://packages.gentoo.org/`. It was also demonstrated that primitive was enough to gain code execution in the context of the PostgreSQL container. The issue was addressed in commit `4fa6e4b619c0362728955b6ec56eab0e0cbf1e23y` of version 1.0.2 using prepared statements to interpolate user-controlled data in SQL queries.","references":["https://github.com/gentoo/soko/security/advisories/GHSA-gc2x-86p3-mxg2","https://gitweb.gentoo.org/sites/soko.git/commit/?id=4fa6e4b619c0362728955b6ec56eab0e0cbf1e23","https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/why-orms-and-prepared-statements-cant-always-win","https://github.com/gentoo/soko/security/advisories/GHSA-gc2x-86p3-mxg2","https://gitweb.gentoo.org/sites/soko.git/commit/?id=4fa6e4b619c0362728955b6ec56eab0e0cbf1e23"]}
