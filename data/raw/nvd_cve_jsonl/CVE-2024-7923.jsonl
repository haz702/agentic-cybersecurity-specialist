{"id":"CVE-2024-7923","publishedDate":"2024-09-04T14:15:14.800","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Pulpcore when deployed with Gunicorn versions prior to 22.0, due to the puppet-pulpcore configuration. This issue arises from Apache's mod_proxy not properly unsetting headers because of restrictions on underscores in HTTP headers, allowing authentication through a malformed header. This flaw impacts all active Satellite deployments (6.13, 6.14 and 6.15) which are using Pulpcore version 3.0+ and could potentially enable unauthorized users to gain administrative access.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6335","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6336","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6337","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8906","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7923","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2305718"]}
