{"id":"CVE-2024-9050","publishedDate":"2024-10-22T13:15:02.410","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A flaw was found in the libreswan client plugin for NetworkManager (NetkworkManager-libreswan), where it fails to properly sanitize the VPN configuration from the local unprivileged user. In this configuration, composed by a key-value format, the plugin fails to escape special characters, leading the application to interpret values as keys. One of the most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is the `leftupdown`key. This key takes an executable command as a value and is used to specify what executes as a callback in NetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to NetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged user to control the system's network configuration, a malicious actor could achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as root in the targeted machine by creating a malicious configuration.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8312","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8338","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8352","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8353","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8354","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8355","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8356","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8357","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8358","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9555","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9556","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9050","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2313828","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/10/25/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/10/25/1"]}
