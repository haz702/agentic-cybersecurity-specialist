{"id":"CVE-2025-2817","publishedDate":"2025-04-29T14:15:32.220","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Thunderbird's update mechanism allowed a medium-integrity user process to interfere with the SYSTEM-level updater by manipulating the file-locking behavior. By injecting code into the user-privileged process, an attacker could bypass intended access controls, allowing SYSTEM-level file operations on paths controlled by a non-privileged user and enabling privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 138, Firefox ESR < 128.10, Firefox ESR < 115.23, Thunderbird < 138, and Thunderbird < 128.10.","references":["https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1917536","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2025-28/","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2025-29/","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2025-30/","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2025-31/","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2025-32/"]}
