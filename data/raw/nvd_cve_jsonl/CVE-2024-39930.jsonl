{"id":"CVE-2024-39930","publishedDate":"2024-07-04T16:15:02.277","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"The built-in SSH server of Gogs through 0.13.0 allows argument injection in internal/ssh/ssh.go, leading to remote code execution. Authenticated attackers can exploit this by opening an SSH connection and sending a malicious --split-string env request if the built-in SSH server is activated. Windows installations are unaffected.","references":["https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases","https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/securing-developer-tools-unpatched-code-vulnerabilities-in-gogs-1/","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/argument-injection-in-gogs-ssh-server-cve-2024-39930","https://github.com/gogs/gogs/releases","https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/securing-developer-tools-unpatched-code-vulnerabilities-in-gogs-1/","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/argument-injection-in-gogs-ssh-server-cve-2024-39930"]}
