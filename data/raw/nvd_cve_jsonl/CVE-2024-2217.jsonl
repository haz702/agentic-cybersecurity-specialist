{"id":"CVE-2024-2217","publishedDate":"2024-04-10T17:15:54.440","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt is vulnerable to improper access control, allowing unauthorized access to the `config.json` file. This vulnerability is present in both authenticated and unauthenticated versions of the application, enabling attackers to obtain sensitive information such as API keys (`openai_api_key`, `google_palm_api_key`, `xmchat_api_key`, etc.), configuration details, and user credentials. The issue stems from the application's handling of HTTP requests for the `config.json` file, which does not properly restrict access based on user authentication.","references":["https://github.com/gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt/commit/c5ae3b5ae6b47259e0ce8730e0a47e85121f4a7d","https://huntr.com/bounties/e4df74bf-b2ee-490f-a9c9-e5c8010b8b29","https://github.com/gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt/commit/c5ae3b5ae6b47259e0ce8730e0a47e85121f4a7d","https://huntr.com/bounties/e4df74bf-b2ee-490f-a9c9-e5c8010b8b29"]}
