Prior to versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1, the cookie consent page in Open Forms contains an open redirect by injecting a `referer` querystring parameter and failing to validate the value. A malicious actor is able to redirect users to a website under their control, opening them up for phishing attacks. The redirect is initiated by the open forms backend which is a legimate page, making it less obvious to end users they are being redirected to a malicious website. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. There are no known workarounds avaialble.","references":["https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/commit/3e8c9cce386e548765783354694fbb9d7a6ea7d3","https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/security/advisories/GHSA-c97h-m5qf-j8mf","https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/commit/3e8c9cce386e548765783354694fbb9d7a6ea7d3","https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/security/advisories/GHSA-c97h-m5qf-j8mf"]}
