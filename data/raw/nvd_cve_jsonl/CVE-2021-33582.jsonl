{"id":"CVE-2021-33582","publishedDate":"2021-09-01T06:15:06.387","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Cyrus IMAP before 3.4.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (multiple-minute daemon hang) via input that is mishandled during hash-table interaction.

This is fixed in 3.4.2, 3.2.8, and 3.0.16.","references":["https://cyrus.topicbox.com/groups/announce/T3dde0a2352462975-M1386fc44adf967e072f8df13/cyrus-imap-3-4-2-3-2-8-and-3-0-16-released","https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-imapd/commits/master","https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-imapd/security/advisories","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/06/msg00013.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6HEO3RURJW6NLIXS7NK5PVU6MGHC4SCM/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WJZB45QBUN7CZFGOWCZYUYACNBTX7LVS/","https://www.cyrusimap.org/imap/download/release-notes/index.html","https://cyrus.topicbox.com/groups/announce/T3dde0a2352462975-M1386fc44adf967e072f8df13/cyrus-imap-3-4-2-3-2-8-and-3-0-16-released","https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-imapd/commits/master","https://github.com/cyrusimap/cyrus-imapd/security/advisories","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/06/msg00013.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6HEO3RURJW6NLIXS7NK5PVU6MGHC4SCM/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WJZB45QBUN7CZFGOWCZYUYACNBTX7LVS/","https://www.cyrusimap.org/imap/download/release-notes/index.html"]}
