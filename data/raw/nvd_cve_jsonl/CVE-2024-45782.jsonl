{"id":"CVE-2024-45782","publishedDate":"2025-03-03T17:15:12.900","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A flaw was found in the HFS filesystem. When reading an HFS volume's name at grub_fs_mount(), the HFS filesystem driver performs a strcpy() using the user-provided volume name as input without properly validating the volume name's length. This issue may read to a heap-based out-of-bounds writer, impacting grub's sensitive data integrity and eventually leading to a secure boot protection bypass.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-45782","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2345858"]}
