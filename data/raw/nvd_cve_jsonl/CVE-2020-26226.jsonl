{"id":"CVE-2020-26226","publishedDate":"2020-11-18T22:15:12.197","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"In the npm package semantic-release before version 17.2.3, secrets that would normally be masked by `semantic-release` can be accidentally disclosed if they contain characters that become encoded when included in a URL. Secrets that do not contain characters that become encoded when included in a URL are already masked properly. The issue is fixed in version 17.2.3.","references":["https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/ca90b34c4a9333438cc4d69faeb43362bb991e5a","https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/security/advisories/GHSA-r2j6-p67h-q639","https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/ca90b34c4a9333438cc4d69faeb43362bb991e5a","https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/security/advisories/GHSA-r2j6-p67h-q639"]}
