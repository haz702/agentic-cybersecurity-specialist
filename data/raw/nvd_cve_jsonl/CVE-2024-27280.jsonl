{"id":"CVE-2024-27280","publishedDate":"2024-05-14T15:11:56.940","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A buffer-overread issue was discovered in StringIO 3.0.1, as distributed in Ruby 3.0.x through 3.0.6 and 3.1.x through 3.1.4. The ungetbyte and ungetc methods on a StringIO can read past the end of a string, and a subsequent call to StringIO.gets may return the memory value. 3.0.3 is the main fixed version; however, for Ruby 3.0 users, a fixed version is stringio 3.0.1.1, and for Ruby 3.1 users, a fixed version is stringio 3.0.1.2.","references":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1399856","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/03/21/buffer-overread-cve-2024-27280/","https://hackerone.com/reports/1399856","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250502-0003/","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2024/03/21/buffer-overread-cve-2024-27280/"]}
