{"id":"CVE-2024-6854","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:34.377","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"In h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0, the endpoint for exporting models does not restrict the export location, allowing an attacker to export a model to any file in the server's file structure, thereby overwriting it. This vulnerability can be exploited to overwrite any file on the target server with a trained model file, although the content of the overwrite is not controllable by the attacker.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/97d013f9-ac51-4c80-8dd7-8dfde11f33b2"]}
