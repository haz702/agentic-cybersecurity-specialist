{"id":"CVE-2023-32071","publishedDate":"2023-05-09T16:15:15.297","cvssV3":9.0,"description":"XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in versions 2.2-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1, it's possible to execute javascript with the right of any user by leading him to a special URL on the wiki targeting a page which contains an attachment. This has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.4, and 14.4.8. The easiest possible workaround is to edit file `<xwiki app>/templates/importinline.vm` and apply the modification described in commit 28905f7f518cc6f21ea61fe37e9e1ed97ef36f01.","references":["https://app.intigriti.com/company/submissions/e95a7ad5-7029-4627-abf0-3e3e3ea0b4ce/XWIKI-E93DFEYK","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/28905f7f518cc6f21ea61fe37e9e1ed97ef36f01","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-j9h5-vcgv-2jfm","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20340","https://app.intigriti.com/company/submissions/e95a7ad5-7029-4627-abf0-3e3e3ea0b4ce/XWIKI-E93DFEYK","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/28905f7f518cc6f21ea61fe37e9e1ed97ef36f01","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-j9h5-vcgv-2jfm","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20340"]}
