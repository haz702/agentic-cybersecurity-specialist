{"id":"CVE-2025-21923","publishedDate":"2025-04-01T16:15:23.007","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: hid-steam: Fix use-after-free when detaching device\n\nWhen a hid-steam device is removed it must clean up the client_hdev used for\nintercepting hidraw access. This can lead to scheduling deferred work to\nreattach the input device. Though the cleanup cancels the deferred work, this\nwas done before the client_hdev itself is cleaned up, so it gets rescheduled.\nThis patch fixes the ordering to make sure the deferred work is properly\ncanceled.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/026714ec7546de741826324a6a1914c91024d06c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a899adf7063c6745aaff1ec869f3c7f6329ed0a1","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e53fc232a65f7488ab75d03a5b95f06aaada7262","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ea3f18d2f02629653b7bfe42607737ccd1343e54"]}
