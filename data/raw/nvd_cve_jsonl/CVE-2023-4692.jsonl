{"id":"CVE-2023-4692","publishedDate":"2023-10-25T18:17:41.743","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in grub2's NTFS filesystem driver. This issue may allow an attacker to present a specially crafted NTFS filesystem image, leading to grub's heap metadata corruption. In some circumstances, the attack may also corrupt the UEFI firmware heap metadata. As a result, arbitrary code execution and secure boot protection bypass may be achieved.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2456","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3184","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4692","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2236613","https://dfir.ru/2023/10/03/cve-2023-4692-cve-2023-4693-vulnerabilities-in-the-grub-boot-manager/","https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2023-10/msg00028.html","https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q4/37","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2456","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3184","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4692","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2236613","https://dfir.ru/2023/10/03/cve-2023-4692-cve-2023-4693-vulnerabilities-in-the-grub-boot-manager/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FUU42E7CPYLATXOYVYNW6YTXXULAOV6L/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OIRJ5UZRXX2KLR4IKBJEQUNGOCXMMDLY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PERFILCHFEUGG3OAMC6W55P6DDIBZK4Q/","https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2023-10/msg00028.html","https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q4/37","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-14","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231208-0002/"]}
