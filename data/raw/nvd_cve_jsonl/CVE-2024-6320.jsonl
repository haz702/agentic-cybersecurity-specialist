{"id":"CVE-2024-6320","publishedDate":"2024-07-09T08:15:12.643","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The ScrollTo Top plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the 'options_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/scrollto-top/trunk/scrollto-top.php?rev=662578#L238","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e11f1a56-d5a2-47a4-a5cc-34345966495a?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/scrollto-top/trunk/scrollto-top.php?rev=662578#L238","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e11f1a56-d5a2-47a4-a5cc-34345966495a?source=cve"]}
