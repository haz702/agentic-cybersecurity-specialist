{"id":"CVE-2024-45391","publishedDate":"2024-09-03T20:15:08.627","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Tina is an open-source content management system (CMS). Sites building with Tina CMS's command line interface (CLI) prior to version 1.6.2 that use a search token may be vulnerable to the search token being leaked via lock file (tina-lock.json). Administrators of Tina-enabled websites with search setup should rotate their key immediately. This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli version 1.6.2. Upgrading and rotating the search token is required for the proper fix.","references":["https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/commit/110f1ceea4574d636a64526648f7c8bf6539b26a","https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/pull/4758","https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/security/advisories/GHSA-4qrm-9h4r-v2fx"]}
