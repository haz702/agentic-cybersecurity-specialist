{"id":"CVE-2022-0952","publishedDate":"2022-05-02T16:15:08.637","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Sitemap by click5 WordPress plugin before 1.0.36 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks when updating options via a REST endpoint, and does not ensure that the option to be updated belongs to the plugin. As a result, unauthenticated attackers could change arbitrary blog options, such as the users_can_register and default_role, allowing them to create a new admin account and take over the blog.","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/0f694961-afab-44f9-846c-e80a0f6c768b","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/0f694961-afab-44f9-846c-e80a0f6c768b"]}
