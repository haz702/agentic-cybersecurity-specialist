{"id":"CVE-2022-45060","publishedDate":"2022-11-09T06:15:09.830","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An HTTP Request Forgery issue was discovered in Varnish Cache 5.x and 6.x before 6.0.11, 7.x before 7.1.2, and 7.2.x before 7.2.1. An attacker may introduce characters through HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This could, in turn, be used to exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server. Note: the 6.0.x LTS series (before 6.0.11) is affected.","references":["https://docs.varnish-software.com/security/VSV00011","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00036.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G6ZMOZVBLZXHEV5VRW4I4SOWLQEK5OF5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M4KVVCIQVINQQ2D7ORNARSYALMJUMP3I/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XGF6LFTHXCSYMYUX5HLMVXQH3WHCSFLU/","https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00011.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5334","https://docs.varnish-software.com/security/VSV00011","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00036.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G6ZMOZVBLZXHEV5VRW4I4SOWLQEK5OF5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M4KVVCIQVINQQ2D7ORNARSYALMJUMP3I/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XGF6LFTHXCSYMYUX5HLMVXQH3WHCSFLU/","https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00011.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5334"]}
