{"id":"CVE-2021-24171","publishedDate":"2021-04-05T19:15:15.857","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The WooCommerce Upload Files WordPress plugin before 59.4 ran a single sanitization pass to remove blocked extensions such as .php. It was possible to bypass this and upload a file with a PHP extension by embedding a \"blocked\" extension within another \"blocked\" extension in the \"wcuf_file_name\" parameter. It was also possible to perform a double extension attack and upload files to a different location via path traversal using the \"wcuf_current_upload_session_id\" parameter.","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/ed4288a1-f7e4-455f-b765-5ac343f87194","https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/03/critical-vulnerability-patched-in-woocommerce-upload-files/","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/ed4288a1-f7e4-455f-b765-5ac343f87194","https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/03/critical-vulnerability-patched-in-woocommerce-upload-files/"]}
