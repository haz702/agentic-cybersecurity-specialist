{"id":"CVE-2024-47533","publishedDate":"2024-11-18T17:15:11.563","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Cobbler, a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network installation environments, has an improper authentication vulnerability starting in version 3.0.0 and prior to versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7. `utils.get_shared_secret()` always returns `-1`, which allows anyone to connect to cobbler XML-RPC as user `''` password `-1` and make any changes. This gives anyone with network access to a cobbler server full control of the server. Versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7 fix the issue.","references":["https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/32c5cada013dc8daa7320a8eda9932c2814742b0","https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/e19717623c10b29e7466ed4ab23515a94beb2dda","https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/security/advisories/GHSA-m26c-fcgh-cp6h"]}
