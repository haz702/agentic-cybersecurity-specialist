{"id":"CVE-2024-23726","publishedDate":"2024-01-21T04:15:19.353","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Ubee DDW365 XCNDDW365 devices have predictable default WPA2 PSKs that could lead to unauthorized remote access. A remote attacker (in proximity to a Wi-Fi network) can derive the default WPA2-PSK value by observing a beacon frame. A PSK is generated by using the first six characters of the SSID and the last six of the BSSID, decrementing the last digit.","references":["https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/Ubee/CWE-1392.md","https://github.com/actuator/cve/blob/main/Ubee/CWE-1392.md"]}
