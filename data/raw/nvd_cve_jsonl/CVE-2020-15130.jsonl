{"id":"CVE-2020-15130","publishedDate":"2020-07-30T15:15:13.057","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In SLPJS (npm package slpjs) before version 0.27.4, there is a vulnerability to false-positive validation outcomes for the NFT1 Child Genesis transaction type. A poorly implemented SLP wallet or opportunistic attacker could create a seemingly valid NFT1 child token without burning any of the NFT1 Group token type as is required by the NFT1 specification. This is fixed in version 0.27.4.","references":["https://github.com/simpleledger/slpjs/commit/290c20e8bff13ac81459d43e54cac232b5e3456c","https://github.com/simpleledger/slpjs/security/advisories/GHSA-cc2p-4jhr-xhhx","https://github.com/simpleledger/slpjs/commit/290c20e8bff13ac81459d43e54cac232b5e3456c","https://github.com/simpleledger/slpjs/security/advisories/GHSA-cc2p-4jhr-xhhx"]}
