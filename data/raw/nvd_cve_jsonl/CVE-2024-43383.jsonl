{"id":"CVE-2024-43383","publishedDate":"2024-10-31T10:15:04.293","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Lucene.Net.Replicator.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Lucene.NET's Replicator library: from 4.8.0-beta00005 through 4.8.0-beta00016.\n\nAn attacker that can intercept traffic between a replication client and server, or control the target replication node URL, can provide a specially-crafted JSON response that is deserialized as an attacker-provided exception type. This can result in remote code execution or other potential unauthorized access.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.8.0-beta00017, which fixes the issue.","references":["https://lists.apache.org/thread/wlz1p76dxpt4rl9o29voxjd5zl7717nh","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/10/31/2"]}
