{"id":"CVE-2024-3622","publishedDate":"2024-04-25T18:15:09.747","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A flaw was found when using mirror-registry to install Quay. It uses a default secret, which is stored in plain-text format in one of the configuration template files. This issue may lead to all instances of Quay deployed using mirror-registry to have the same secret key. This flaw allows a malicious actor to craft session cookies and as a consequence, it may lead to gaining access to the affected Quay instance.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-3622","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2274400","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-3622","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2274400"]}
