{"id":"CVE-2022-29228","publishedDate":"2022-06-09T20:15:08.197","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 the OAuth filter would try to invoke the remaining filters in the chain after emitting a local response, which triggers an ASSERT() in newer versions and corrupts memory on earlier versions. continueDecoding() shouldn\u2019t ever be called from filters after a local reply has been sent. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","references":["https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/7ffda4e809dec74449ebc330cebb9d2f4ab61360","https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-rww6-8h7g-8jf6","https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/7ffda4e809dec74449ebc330cebb9d2f4ab61360","https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-rww6-8h7g-8jf6"]}
