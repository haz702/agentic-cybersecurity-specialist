{"id":"CVE-2022-1271","publishedDate":"2022-08-31T16:15:09.347","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep utility. When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1271","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073310","https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6","https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gzip/2022-04/msg00011.html","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220930-0006/","https://tukaani.org/xz/xzgrep-ZDI-CAN-16587.patch","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/07/8","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1271","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073310","https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6","https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gzip/2022-04/msg00011.html","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220930-0006/","https://tukaani.org/xz/xzgrep-ZDI-CAN-16587.patch","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/07/8"]}
