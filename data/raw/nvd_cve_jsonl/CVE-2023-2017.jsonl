{"id":"CVE-2023-2017","publishedDate":"2023-04-17T11:15:42.160","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Server-side Template Injection (SSTI) in Shopware 6 (<= v6.4.20.0, v6.5.0.0-rc1 <= v6.5.0.0-rc4), affecting both shopware/core and shopware/platform GitHub repositories, allows remote attackers with access to a Twig environment without the Sandbox extension to bypass the validation checks in `Shopware\\Core\\Framework\\Adapter\\Twig\\SecurityExtension` and call any arbitrary PHP function and thus execute arbitrary code/commands via usage of fully-qualified names, supplied as array of strings, when referencing callables. Users are advised to upgrade to v6.4.20.1 to resolve this issue. This is a bypass of CVE-2023-22731.\n","references":["https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/security-updates/security-update-04-2023","https://github.com/shopware/platform/security/advisories/GHSA-7v2v-9rm4-7m8f","https://starlabs.sg/advisories/23/23-2017/","https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/security-updates/security-update-04-2023","https://github.com/shopware/platform/security/advisories/GHSA-7v2v-9rm4-7m8f","https://starlabs.sg/advisories/23/23-2017/"]}
