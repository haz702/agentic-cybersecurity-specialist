The MITM attacker can use the identified Passkey value to complete authentication with the Responder via Bluetooth pairing method confusion.","references":["https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/reporting-security/","https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/reporting-security/"]}
