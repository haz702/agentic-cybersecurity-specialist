Unless Linear Address\nSpace Separation (LASS) is enabled this weakness may be exploitable.\n\nUntil kernel adds support for LASS[2], only allow LAM for COMPILE_TEST,\nor when speculation mitigations have been disabled at compile time,\notherwise keep LAM disabled.\n\nThere are no processors in market that support LAM yet, so currently\nnobody is affected by this issue.\n\n[1] SLAM: https://download.vusec.net/papers/slam_sp24.pdf\n[2] LASS: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230609183632.48706-1-alexander.shishkin@linux.intel.com/\n\n[ dhansen: update SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS -> CPU_MITIGATIONS ]","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3267cb6d3a174ff83d6287dcd5b0047bbd912452","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/60a5ba560f296ad8da153f6ad3f70030bfa3958f","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/690599066488d16db96ac0d6340f9372fc56f337"]}
