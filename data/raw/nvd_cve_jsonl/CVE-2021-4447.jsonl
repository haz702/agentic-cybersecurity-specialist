{"id":"CVE-2021-4447","publishedDate":"2024-10-16T07:15:10.687","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Essential Addons for Elementor  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to and including 4.6.4 due to a lack of restrictions on who can add a registration form and a custom registration role to an Elementor created page. This makes it possible for attackers with access to the Elementor page builder to create a new registration form that defaults to the user role being set to administrator and subsequently register as an administrative user.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2526471%40essential-addons-for-elementor-lite&new=2526471%40essential-addons-for-elementor-lite&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/be098ee9-b749-4908-85e8-e717d019609a?source=cve"]}
