{"id":"CVE-2024-27392","publishedDate":"2024-05-01T13:15:51.793","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvme: host: fix double-free of struct nvme_id_ns in ns_update_nuse()\n\nWhen nvme_identify_ns() fails, it frees the pointer to the struct\nnvme_id_ns before it returns. However, ns_update_nuse() calls kfree()\nfor the pointer even when nvme_identify_ns() fails. This results in\nKASAN double-free, which was observed with blktests nvme/045 with\nproposed patches [1] on the kernel v6.8-rc7. Fix the double-free by\nskipping kfree() when nvme_identify_ns() fails.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/534f9dc7fe495b3f9cc84363898ac50c5a25fccb","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d0d2447394b13fb22a069f0330f9c49b7fff9d3","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/534f9dc7fe495b3f9cc84363898ac50c5a25fccb","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d0d2447394b13fb22a069f0330f9c49b7fff9d3"]}
