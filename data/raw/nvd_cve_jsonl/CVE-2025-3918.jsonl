{"id":"CVE-2025-3918","publishedDate":"2025-05-03T03:15:28.040","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Job Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to improper authorization within the register_action() function in versions 0.1 to 0.1.1. The plugin\u2019s registration handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['user_role'] and passes it directly to wp_insert_user() without restricting to a safe set of roles.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/job-listings/trunk/includes/forms/class-jlt-form-member.php#L68","https://wordpress.org/plugins/job-listings/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c9cd43f5-c3d0-4eb2-9c18-1af2edca37ff?source=cve"]}
