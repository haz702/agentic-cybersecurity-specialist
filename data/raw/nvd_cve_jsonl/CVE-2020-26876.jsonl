{"id":"CVE-2020-26876","publishedDate":"2020-10-07T17:15:15.863","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The wp-courses plugin through 2.0.27 for WordPress allows remote attackers to bypass the intended payment step (for course videos and materials) by using the /wp-json REST API, as exploited in the wild in September 2020. This occurs because show_in_rest is enabled for custom post types (e.g., /wp-json/wp/v2/course and /wp-json/wp/v2/lesson exist).","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2388997","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2389243","https://www.redtimmy.com/critical-information-disclosure-on-wp-courses-plugin-exposes-private-course-videos-and-materials/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2388997","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2389243","https://www.redtimmy.com/critical-information-disclosure-on-wp-courses-plugin-exposes-private-course-videos-and-materials/"]}
