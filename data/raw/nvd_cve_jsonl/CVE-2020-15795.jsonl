{"id":"CVE-2020-15795","publishedDate":"2021-04-22T21:15:09.090","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"A vulnerability has been identified in APOGEE PXC Compact (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5), APOGEE PXC Compact (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.20), APOGEE PXC Modular (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5), APOGEE PXC Modular (P2 Ethernet) (All versions < V2.8.20), Nucleus NET (All versions < V5.2), Nucleus Source Code (Versions including affected DNS modules), TALON TC Compact (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5), TALON TC Modular (BACnet) (All versions < V3.5.5). The DNS domain name label parsing functionality does not properly validate the names in DNS-responses. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process or cause a denial-of-service condition.","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-180579.pdf","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-185699.pdf","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-180579.pdf","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-185699.pdf"]}
