{"id":"CVE-2022-25333","publishedDate":"2023-10-19T10:15:09.747","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"The Texas Instruments OMAP L138 (secure variants) trusted execution environment (TEE) performs an RSA check implemented in mask ROM when loading a module through the SK_LOAD routine. However, only the module header authenticity is validated. An adversary can re-use any correctly signed header and append a forged payload, to be encrypted using the CEK (obtainable through CVE-2022-25332) in order to obtain arbitrary code execution in secure context. This constitutes a full break of the TEE security architecture.","references":["https://tetraburst.com/","https://tetraburst.com/"]}
