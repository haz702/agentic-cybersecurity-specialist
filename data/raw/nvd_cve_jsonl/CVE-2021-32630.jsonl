{"id":"CVE-2021-32630","publishedDate":"2021-05-20T17:15:07.773","cvssV3":9.6,"description":"Admidio is a free, open source user management system for websites of organizations and groups. In Admidio before version 4.0.4, there is an authenticated RCE via .phar file upload. A php web shell can be uploaded via the Documents & Files upload feature. Someone with upload permissions could rename the php shell with a .phar extension, visit the file, triggering the payload for a reverse/bind shell. This can be mitigated by excluding a .phar file extension to be uploaded (like you did with .php .phtml .php5 etc). The vulnerability is patched in version 4.0.4.","references":["https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/issues/994","https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/releases/tag/v4.0.4","https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-xpqj-67r8-25j2","https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/issues/994","https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/releases/tag/v4.0.4","https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-xpqj-67r8-25j2"]}
