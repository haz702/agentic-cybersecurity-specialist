{"id":"CVE-2024-45496","publishedDate":"2024-09-17T00:15:52.433","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"A flaw was found in OpenShift. This issue occurs due to the misuse of elevated privileges in the OpenShift Container Platform's build process. During the build initialization step, the git-clone container is run with a privileged security context, allowing unrestricted access to the node. An attacker with developer-level access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file containing commands executed during the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker node. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3718","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6685","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6687","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6689","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6691","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6705","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-45496","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2308661"]}
