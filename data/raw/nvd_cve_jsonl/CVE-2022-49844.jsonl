This\nout-of-bounds read may lead to CAN frame drops for virtual CAN\ninterfaces like vcan and vxcan.\n\nThis patch mainly reverts the original commit and adds a new helper\nfor CAN interface drivers that provide the required information in\nstruct can_priv.\n\n[mkl: patch pch_can, too]","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/386c49fe31ee748e053860b3bac7794a933ac9ac","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ae64438be1923e3c1102d90fd41db7afcfaf54cc"]}
