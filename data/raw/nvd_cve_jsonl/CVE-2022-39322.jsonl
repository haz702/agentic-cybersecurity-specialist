{"id":"CVE-2022-39322","publishedDate":"2022-10-25T17:15:56.020","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"@keystone-6/core is a core package for Keystone 6, a content management system for Node.js. Starting with version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.3.1, users who expected their `multiselect` fields to use the field-level access control - if configured - are vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used. List-level access control is not affected. Field-level access control for fields other than `multiselect` are not affected. Version 2.3.1 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, stop using the `multiselect` field.","references":["https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/commit/65c6ee3deef23605fc72b80230908696a7a65e7c","https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-6mhr-52mv-6v6f","https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/commit/65c6ee3deef23605fc72b80230908696a7a65e7c","https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-6mhr-52mv-6v6f"]}
