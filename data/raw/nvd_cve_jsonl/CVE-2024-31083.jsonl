{"id":"CVE-2024-31083","publishedDate":"2024-04-05T12:15:37.577","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function of Xorg servers. This issue occurs when AllocateGlyph() is called to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X server, potentially resulting in multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs. Consequently, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, leading to a use-after-free scenario when the same glyph pointer is subsequently accessed. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted request.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1785","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2036","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2037","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2038","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2039","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2040","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2041","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2042","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2080","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2616","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3258","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3261","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3343","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9093","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9122","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-31083","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2272000","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/13","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/10","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1785","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2036","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2037","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2038","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2039","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2040","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2041","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2042","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2080","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2616","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3258","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3261","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3343","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-31083","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2272000","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00009.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6TF7FZXOKHIKPZXYIMSQXKVH7WITKV3V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EBLQJIAXEDMEGRGZMSH7CWUJHSVKUWLV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/P73U4DAAWLFZAPD75GLXTGMSTTQWW5AP/"]}
