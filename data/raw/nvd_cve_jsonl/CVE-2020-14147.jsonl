{"id":"CVE-2020-14147","publishedDate":"2020-06-15T18:15:14.990","cvssV3":7.7,"description":"An integer overflow in the getnum function in lua_struct.c in Redis before 6.0.3 allows context-dependent attackers with permission to run Lua code in a Redis session to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly bypass intended sandbox restrictions via a large number, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow. NOTE: this issue exists because of a CVE-2015-8080 regression.","references":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00058.html","https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/ef764dde1cca2f25d00686673d1bc89448819571","https://github.com/antirez/redis/pull/6875","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-17","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4731","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00058.html","https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/ef764dde1cca2f25d00686673d1bc89448819571","https://github.com/antirez/redis/pull/6875","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-17","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4731","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html"]}
