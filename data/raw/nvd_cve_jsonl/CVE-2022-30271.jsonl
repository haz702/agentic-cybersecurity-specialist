{"id":"CVE-2022-30271","publishedDate":"2022-07-26T23:15:08.177","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Motorola ACE1000 RTU through 2022-05-02 ships with a hardcoded SSH private key and initialization scripts (such as /etc/init.d/sshd_service) only generate a new key if no private-key file exists. Thus, this hardcoded key is likely to be used by default.","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-179-06","https://www.forescout.com/blog/","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-179-06","https://www.forescout.com/blog/"]}
