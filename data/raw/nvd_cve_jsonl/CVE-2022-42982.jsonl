{"id":"CVE-2022-42982","publishedDate":"2022-11-17T05:15:15.440","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"BKG Professional NtripCaster 2.0.39 allows querying information over the UDP protocol without authentication. The NTRIP sourcetable is typically quite long (tens of kBs) and can be requested with a packet of only 30 bytes. This presents a vector that can be used for UDP amplification attacks. Normally, only authenticated streaming data will be provided over UDP and not the sourcetable.","references":["https://cve.mahi.be/bkg_ntrip_udp/","https://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/bkgcaster","https://cve.mahi.be/bkg_ntrip_udp/","https://igs.bkg.bund.de/ntrip/bkgcaster"]}
