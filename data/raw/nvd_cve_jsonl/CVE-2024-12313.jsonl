{"id":"CVE-2024-12313","publishedDate":"2025-01-07T05:15:17.853","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The Compare Products for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.1 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'woo_compare_list' cookie. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-compare-products/trunk/classes/class-wc-compare-functions.php#L219","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-compare-products/trunk/classes/class-wc-compare-functions.php#L237","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-compare-products/trunk/classes/class-wc-compare-functions.php#L256","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-compare-products/trunk/classes/class-wc-compare-functions.php#L275","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/638e8e67-38b3-4fc4-bd77-8f268030a93a?source=cve"]}
