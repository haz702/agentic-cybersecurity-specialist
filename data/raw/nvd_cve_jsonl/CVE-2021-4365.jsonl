{"id":"CVE-2021-4365","publishedDate":"2023-06-07T02:15:14.603","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking authentication protections and santisation all on the wpfm_edit_file_title_desc AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.","references":["https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-frontend-file-manager-plugin-fixed-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2554359%40nmedia-user-file-uploader&new=2554359%40nmedia-user-file-uploader&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a9c82154-d390-44ba-a54a-89f4bb69cdce?source=cve","https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-frontend-file-manager-plugin-fixed-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2554359%40nmedia-user-file-uploader&new=2554359%40nmedia-user-file-uploader&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a9c82154-d390-44ba-a54a-89f4bb69cdce?source=cve"]}
