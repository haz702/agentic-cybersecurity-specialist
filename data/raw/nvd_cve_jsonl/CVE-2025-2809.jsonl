This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/azurecurve-shortcodes-in-comments/trunk/azurecurve-shortcodes-in-comments.php#L35","https://wordpress.org/plugins/azurecurve-shortcodes-in-comments/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/22cc6da1-fd22-4b2a-90ab-24086879f0f6?source=cve"]}
