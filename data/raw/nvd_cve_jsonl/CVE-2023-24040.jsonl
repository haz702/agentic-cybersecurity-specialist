{"id":"CVE-2023-24040","publishedDate":"2023-01-21T02:15:09.680","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"dtprintinfo in Common Desktop Environment 1.6 has a bug in the parser of lpstat (an invoked external command) during listing of the names of available printers. This allows low-privileged local users to inject arbitrary printer names via the $HOME/.printers file. This injection allows those users to manipulate the control flow and disclose memory contents on Solaris 10 systems. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/24","https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns/blob/main/HNS-2022-01-dtprintinfo.txt","https://security.humanativaspa.it/nothing-new-under-the-sun/","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/24","https://github.com/hnsecurity/vulns/blob/main/HNS-2022-01-dtprintinfo.txt","https://security.humanativaspa.it/nothing-new-under-the-sun/"]}
