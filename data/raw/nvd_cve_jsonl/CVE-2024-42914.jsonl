By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker to reset other users' passwords.","references":["https://github.com/soursec/CVEs/tree/main/CVE-2024-42914","https://github.com/trquoccuong/ArrowCMS/"]}
