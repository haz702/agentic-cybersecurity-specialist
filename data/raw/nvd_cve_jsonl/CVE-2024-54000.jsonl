{"id":"CVE-2024-54000","publishedDate":"2024-12-03T16:15:24.380","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis. In versions prior to 3.9.7, the requests.get() request in the _check_url method is specified as allow_redirects=True, which allows a server-side request forgery when a request to .well-known/assetlinks.json\" returns a 302 redirect. This is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2024-29190 and is fixed in 3.9.7.","references":["https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/commit/f22c584aa7d43527970c9da61eb678953cfc0a8e","https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/security/advisories/GHSA-m435-9v6r-v5f6"]}
