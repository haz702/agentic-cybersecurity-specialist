{"id":"CVE-2024-39721","publishedDate":"2024-10-31T20:15:04.993","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An issue was discovered in Ollama before 0.1.34. The CreateModelHandler function uses os.Open to read a file until completion. The req.Path parameter is user-controlled and can be set to /dev/random, which is blocking, causing the goroutine to run infinitely (even after the HTTP request is aborted by the client).","references":["https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/9164b0161bcb24e543cba835a8863b80af2c0c21/server/routes.go#L557","https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/adeb40eaf29039b8964425f69a9315f9f1694ba8/server/routes.go#L536","https://www.oligo.security/blog/more-models-more-probllms"]}
