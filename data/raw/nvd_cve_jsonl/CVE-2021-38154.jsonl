{"id":"CVE-2021-38154","publishedDate":"2021-08-29T05:15:06.300","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Certain Canon devices manufactured in 2012 through 2020 (such as imageRUNNER ADVANCE iR-ADV C5250), when Catwalk Server is enabled for HTTP access, allow remote attackers to modify an e-mail address setting, and thus cause the device to send sensitive information through e-mail to the attacker. For example, an incoming FAX may be sent through e-mail to the attacker. This occurs when a PIN is not required for General User Mode, as exploited in the wild in August 2021.","references":["https://protocolpolice.nl/CVE-2021-38154_Protocol_Police_Catwalk_Alert","https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/product-advisories","https://protocolpolice.nl/CVE-2021-38154_Protocol_Police_Catwalk_Alert","https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/product-advisories"]}
