During SDK installation, certutil.exe is called by the Acuant installer to install certificates. This window is not hidden, and is running with elevated privileges. A standard user can break out of this window, obtaining a full SYSTEM command prompt window. This results in complete compromise via arbitrary SYSTEM code execution (elevation of privileges).","references":["https://acuant.com","https://hackandpwn.com/disclosures/CVE-2022-48222.pdf","https://acuant.com","https://hackandpwn.com/disclosures/CVE-2022-48222.pdf"]}
