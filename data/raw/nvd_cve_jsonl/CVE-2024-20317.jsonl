An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific types of Ethernet frames to or through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause control plane protocol relationships to fail, resulting in a DoS condition. For more information, see the  section of this advisory.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.","references":["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-l2services-2mvHdNuC"]}
