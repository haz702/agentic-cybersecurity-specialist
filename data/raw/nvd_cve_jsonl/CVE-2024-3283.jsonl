{"id":"CVE-2024-3283","publishedDate":"2024-04-10T17:15:56.600","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"A vulnerability in mintplex-labs/anything-llm allows users with manager roles to escalate their privileges to admin roles through a mass assignment issue. The '/admin/system-preferences' API endpoint improperly authorizes manager-level users to modify the 'multi_user_mode' system variable, enabling them to access the '/api/system/enable-multi-user' endpoint and create a new admin user. This issue results from the endpoint accepting a full JSON object in the request body without proper validation of modifiable fields, leading to unauthorized modification of system settings and subsequent privilege escalation.","references":["https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/52fac844221a9b951d08ceb93c4c014e9397b1f2","https://huntr.com/bounties/a8000cce-0ecb-4820-9cfb-57ba6f4d58a2","https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/52fac844221a9b951d08ceb93c4c014e9397b1f2","https://huntr.com/bounties/a8000cce-0ecb-4820-9cfb-57ba6f4d58a2"]}
