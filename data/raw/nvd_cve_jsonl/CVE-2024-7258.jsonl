{"id":"CVE-2024-7258","publishedDate":"2024-08-23T05:15:15.437","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The WooCommerce Google Feed Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wppfm_removeFeedFile' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-product-feed-manager/trunk/includes/data/js/wppfm_ajaxdatahandling.js#L537","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-product-feed-manager/trunk/includes/data/js/wppfm_ajaxdatahandling.js#L546","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-product-feed-manager/trunk/includes/data/js/wppfm_ajaxdatahandling.js#L575","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3137475/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ffd6e18d-9173-4911-af64-5d54c6d2e052?source=cve"]}
