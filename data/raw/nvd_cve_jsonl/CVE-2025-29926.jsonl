{"id":"CVE-2025-29926","publishedDate":"2025-03-19T18:15:25.770","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Prior to 15.10.15, 16.4.6, and 16.10.0, any user can exploit the WikiManager REST API to create a new wiki, where the user could become an administrator and so performs other attacks on the farm. Note that this REST API is not bundled in XWiki Standard by default: it needs to be installed manually through the extension manager. The problem has been patched in versions 15.10.15, 16.4.6 and 16.10.0 of the REST module.","references":["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/82aa670106c7f5e6238ca6ed59a52d1800e05b99","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-gfp2-6qhm-7x43","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22490"]}
