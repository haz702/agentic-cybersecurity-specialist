{"id":"CVE-2020-15195","publishedDate":"2020-09-25T19:15:14.743","cvssV3":8.5,"description":"In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the implementation of `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` uses a double indexing pattern. It is possible for `reverse_index_map(i)` to be an index outside of bounds of `grad_values`, thus resulting in a heap buffer overflow. The issue is patched in commit 390611e0d45c5793c7066110af37c8514e6a6c54, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.","references":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html","https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/390611e0d45c5793c7066110af37c8514e6a6c54","https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1","https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-63xm-rx5p-xvqr","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html","https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/390611e0d45c5793c7066110af37c8514e6a6c54","https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1","https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-63xm-rx5p-xvqr"]}
