{"id":"CVE-2024-42381","publishedDate":"2024-07-31T06:15:02.130","cvssV3":8.3,"description":"os/linux/elf.rb in Homebrew brew before 4.2.20 uses ldd to load ELF files obtained from untrusted sources, which allows attackers to achieve code execution via an ELF file with a custom .interp section. NOTE: this code execution would occur during an un-sandboxed binary relocation phase, which occurs before a user would expect execution of downloaded package content. (237d1e783f7ee261beaba7d3f6bde22da7148b0a was the tested vulnerable version.)","references":["https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/07/30/our-audit-of-homebrew/","https://brew.sh/2024/07/30/homebrew-security-audit/","https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/commit/916b37388d3851a8a93a8e9b4adc38873680ead7","https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/17136","https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/tag/4.2.20","https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tree/237d1e783f7ee261beaba7d3f6bde22da7148b0a","https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-08-28-homebrew-securityreview.pdf"]}
