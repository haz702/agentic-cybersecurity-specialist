{"id":"CVE-2023-3390","publishedDate":"2023-06-28T21:15:10.447","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c.\n\nMishandled error handling with NFT_MSG_NEWRULE makes it possible to use a dangling pointer in the same transaction causing a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows a local attacker with user access to cause a privilege escalation issue.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit\u00a01240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174577/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0097-1.html","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=1240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97","https://kernel.dance/1240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00001.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0004/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5448","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5461","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174577/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0097-1.html","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=1240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97","https://kernel.dance/1240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00001.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0004/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5448","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5461"]}
