{"id":"CVE-2024-47540","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:28.343","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An uninitialized stack variable vulnerability has been identified in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. When size < 4, the program calls gst_buffer_unmap with an uninitialized map variable. Then, in the gst_memory_unmap function, the program will attempt to unmap the buffer using the uninitialized map variable, causing a function pointer hijack, as it will jump to mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full or mem->allocator->mem_unmap. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack the execution flow, potentially leading to code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8057.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0017.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-197_GStreamer/"]}
