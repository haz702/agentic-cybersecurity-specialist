{"id":"CVE-2025-24896","publishedDate":"2025-02-11T16:15:51.477","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, a login token named `token` is stored in a cookie for authentication purposes in Bull Dashboard, but this remains undeleted even after logout is performed. The primary affected users will be users who have logged into Misskey using a public PC or someone else's device, but it's possible that users who have logged out of Misskey before lending their PC to someone else could also be affected. Version 2025.2.0-alpha.0 contains a fix for this issue.","references":["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/ba9f295ef2bf31cc90fa587e20b9a7655b7a1824","https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-w98m-j6hq-cwjm"]}
