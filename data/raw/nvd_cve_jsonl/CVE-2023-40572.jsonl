{"id":"CVE-2023-40572","publishedDate":"2023-08-24T02:15:09.643","cvssV3":9.0,"description":"XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. The create action is vulnerable to a CSRF attack, allowing script and thus remote code execution when targeting a user with script/programming right, thus compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. When a user with script right views this image and a log message `ERROR foo - Script executed!` appears in the log, the XWiki installation is vulnerable. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.9 and 15.4RC1 by requiring a CSRF token for the actual page creation.","references":["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/4b20528808d0c311290b0d9ab2cfc44063380ef7","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-4f8m-7h83-9f6m","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20849","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/4b20528808d0c311290b0d9ab2cfc44063380ef7","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-4f8m-7h83-9f6m","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20849"]}
