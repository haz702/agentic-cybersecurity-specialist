{"id":"CVE-2024-28115","publishedDate":"2024-03-07T21:15:08.567","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system for microcontrollers. FreeRTOS Kernel versions through 10.6.1 do not sufficiently protect against local privilege escalation via Return Oriented Programming techniques should a vulnerability exist that allows code injection and execution. These issues affect ARMv7-M MPU ports, and ARMv8-M ports with Memory Protected Unit (MPU) support enabled (i.e. `configENABLE_MPU` set to 1). These issues are fixed in version 10.6.2 with a new MPU wrapper.
