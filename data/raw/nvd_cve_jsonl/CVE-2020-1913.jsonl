{"id":"CVE-2020-1913","publishedDate":"2020-09-09T19:15:21.007","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"An Integer signedness error in the JavaScript Interpreter in Facebook Hermes prior to commit 2c7af7ec481ceffd0d14ce2d7c045e475fd71dc6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service attack or a potential RCE via crafted JavaScript. Note that this is only exploitable if the application using Hermes permits evaluation of untrusted JavaScript. Hence, most React Native applications are not affected.","references":["https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/2c7af7ec481ceffd0d14ce2d7c045e475fd71dc6","https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2020-1913","https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/2c7af7ec481ceffd0d14ce2d7c045e475fd71dc6","https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2020-1913"]}
