{"id":"CVE-2024-11925","publishedDate":"2024-11-28T07:15:05.267","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a users identity when verifying an email address through the user_account_activation function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including site administrators if the users email is known.","references":["https://codecanyon.net/item/jobsearch-wp-job-board-wordpress-plugin/21066856","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/04bc8101-2676-4695-a498-f79be8221617?source=cve"]}
