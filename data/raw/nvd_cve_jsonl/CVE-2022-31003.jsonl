{"id":"CVE-2022-31003","publishedDate":"2022-05-31T20:15:07.910","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-Agent library. Prior to version 1.13.8, when parsing each line of a sdp message, `rest = record + 2` will access the memory behind `\\0` and cause an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, causing a crash or more serious consequence, such as remote code execution. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for this issue.","references":["https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/commit/907f2ac0ee504c93ebfefd676b4632a3575908c9","https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8w5j-6g2j-pxcp","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00001.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-18","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5410","https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/commit/907f2ac0ee504c93ebfefd676b4632a3575908c9","https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8w5j-6g2j-pxcp","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00001.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-18","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5410"]}
