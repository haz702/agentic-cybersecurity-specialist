{"id":"CVE-2025-2525","publishedDate":"2025-04-08T02:15:20.363","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.","references":["https://documentation.iqonic.design/streamit/change-log/streamit-v4-0/","https://themeforest.net/item/streamit-video-streaming-wordpress-theme/29772881","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/83a58119-d0ed-47fe-93d1-1aa1def2cf44?source=cve"]}
