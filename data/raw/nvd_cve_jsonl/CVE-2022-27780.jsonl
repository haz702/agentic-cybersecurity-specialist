{"id":"CVE-2022-27780","publishedDate":"2022-06-02T14:15:44.267","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators like '/'when decoding the host name part of a URL, making it a *different* URL usingthe wrong host name when it is later retrieved.For example, a URL like `http://example.com%2F127.0.0.1/`, would be allowed bythe parser and get transposed into `http://example.com/127.0.0.1/`. This flawcan be used to circumvent filters, checks and more.","references":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1553841","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202212-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220609-0009/","https://hackerone.com/reports/1553841","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202212-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220609-0009/"]}
