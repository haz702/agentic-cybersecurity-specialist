{"id":"CVE-2022-48338","publishedDate":"2023-02-20T23:15:12.297","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"An issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. In ruby-mode.el, the ruby-find-library-file function has a local command injection vulnerability. The ruby-find-library-file function is an interactive function, and bound to C-c C-f. Inside the function, the external command gem is called through shell-command-to-string, but the feature-name parameters are not escaped. Thus, malicious Ruby source files may cause commands to be executed.","references":["https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=9a3b08061feea14d6f37685ca1ab8801758bfd1c","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FLPQ4K6H2S5TY3L5UDN4K4B3L5RQJYQ6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U6HDBUQNAH2WL4MHWCTUZLN7NGF7CHTK/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5360","https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=9a3b08061feea14d6f37685ca1ab8801758bfd1c","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FLPQ4K6H2S5TY3L5UDN4K4B3L5RQJYQ6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U6HDBUQNAH2WL4MHWCTUZLN7NGF7CHTK/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5360"]}
