{"id":"CVE-2024-31206","publishedDate":"2024-04-04T23:15:15.897","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"dectalk-tts is a Node package to interact with the aeiou Dectalk web API. In `dectalk-tts@1.0.0`, network requests to the third-party API are sent over HTTP, which is unencrypted. Unencrypted traffic can be easily intercepted and modified by attackers. Anyone who uses the package could be the victim of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The network request was upgraded to HTTPS in version `1.0.1`. There are no workarounds, but some precautions include not sending any sensitive information and carefully verifying the API response before saving it.","references":["https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/blob/b3e92156cbb699218ac9b9c7d8979abd0e635767/src/index.ts#L18","https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/commit/3600d8ac156f27da553ac4ead46d16989a350105","https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/issues/3","https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/pull/4","https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/security/advisories/GHSA-6cf6-8hvr-r68w","https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/blob/b3e92156cbb699218ac9b9c7d8979abd0e635767/src/index.ts#L18","https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/commit/3600d8ac156f27da553ac4ead46d16989a350105","https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/issues/3","https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/pull/4","https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/security/advisories/GHSA-6cf6-8hvr-r68w"]}
