{"id":"CVE-2024-57980","publishedDate":"2025-02-27T02:15:11.190","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: uvcvideo: Fix double free in error path\n\nIf the uvc_status_init() function fails to allocate the int_urb, it will\nfree the dev->status pointer but doesn't reset the pointer to NULL. This\nresults in the kfree() call in uvc_status_cleanup() trying to\ndouble-free the memory. Fix it by resetting the dev->status pointer to\nNULL after freeing it.\n\nReviewed by: Ricardo Ribalda <ribalda@chromium.org>","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3ba8884a56a3eb97c22f0ce0e4dd410d4ca4c277","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6c36dcd662ec5276782838660f8533a7cb26be49","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/87522ef165e5b6de8ef98cc318f3335166a1512c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9232719ac9ce4d5c213cebda23d72aec3e1c4c0d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c6ef3a7fa97ec823a1e1af9085cf13db9f7b3bac","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d1f8e69eec91d5a75ef079778a5d0151db2a7f22","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d6e5ba2516c5bef87c1fcb8189b6f3cad7c64b2d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d8e63dd7b6683969d3d47c7b8e9635f96d554ad4"]}
