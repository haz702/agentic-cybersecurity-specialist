{"id":"CVE-2022-36076","publishedDate":"2022-09-02T13:15:08.847","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis, MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process, the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack could theoretically take over another user account during the single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version 1.17.2.","references":["https://blogs.opera.com/security/2022/03/bug-bounty-adventures-a-nodebb-0-day/","https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/a2400f6baff44cb2996487bcd0cc6e2acc74b3d4","https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-xmgg-fx9p-prq6","https://blogs.opera.com/security/2022/03/bug-bounty-adventures-a-nodebb-0-day/","https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/a2400f6baff44cb2996487bcd0cc6e2acc74b3d4","https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-xmgg-fx9p-prq6"]}
