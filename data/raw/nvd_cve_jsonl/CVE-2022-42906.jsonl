{"id":"CVE-2022-42906","publishedDate":"2022-10-13T03:15:09.130","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"powerline-gitstatus (aka Powerline Gitstatus) before 1.3.2 allows arbitrary code execution. git repositories can contain per-repository configuration that changes the behavior of git, including running arbitrary commands. When using powerline-gitstatus, changing to a directory automatically runs git commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory to one controlled by the attacker, such as in a shared filesystem or extracted archive, powerline-gitstatus will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2022-20001.","references":["https://github.com/jaspernbrouwer/powerline-gitstatus/issues/45","https://github.com/jaspernbrouwer/powerline-gitstatus/releases/tag/v1.3.2","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00017.html","https://github.com/jaspernbrouwer/powerline-gitstatus/issues/45","https://github.com/jaspernbrouwer/powerline-gitstatus/releases/tag/v1.3.2","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00017.html"]}
