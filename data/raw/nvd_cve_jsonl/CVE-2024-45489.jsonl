{"id":"CVE-2024-45489","publishedDate":"2024-09-20T17:15:15.060","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Arc before 2024-08-26 allows remote code execution in JavaScript boosts. Boosts that run JavaScript cannot be shared by default; however (because of misconfigured Firebase ACLs), it is possible to create or update a boost using another user's ID. This installs the boost in the victim's browser and runs arbitrary Javascript on that browser in a privileged context. NOTE: this is a no-action cloud vulnerability with zero affected users.","references":["https://arc.net/blog/CVE-2024-45489-incident-response","https://kibty.town/blog/arc/","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41597250"]}
