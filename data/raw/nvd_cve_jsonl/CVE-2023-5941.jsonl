{"id":"CVE-2023-5941","publishedDate":"2023-11-08T09:15:07.847","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"In versions of FreeBSD 12.4-RELEASE prior to 12.4-RELEASE-p7 and FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE prior to 13.2-RELEASE-p5 the __sflush() stdio function in libc does not correctly update FILE objects' write space members for write-buffered streams when the write(2) system call returns an error. \u00a0Depending on the nature of an application that calls libc's stdio functions and the presence of errors returned from the write(2) system call (or an overridden stdio write routine) a heap buffer overflow may occur.  Such overflows may lead to data corruption or the execution of arbitrary code at the privilege level of the calling program.","references":["https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-23:15.stdio.asc","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231214-0004/","https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-23:15.stdio.asc","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231214-0004/"]}
