{"id":"CVE-2024-42452","publishedDate":"2024-12-04T02:15:04.747","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication allows a low-privileged user to start an agent remotely in server mode and obtain credentials, effectively escalating privileges to system-level access. This allows the attacker to upload files to the server with elevated privileges. The vulnerability exists because remote calls bypass permission checks, leading to full system compromise.","references":["https://www.veeam.com/kb4693"]}
