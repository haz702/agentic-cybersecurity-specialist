{"id":"CVE-2022-48657","publishedDate":"2024-04-28T13:15:07.717","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: topology: fix possible overflow in amu_fie_setup()\n\ncpufreq_get_hw_max_freq() returns max frequency in kHz as *unsigned int*,\nwhile freq_inv_set_max_ratio() gets passed this frequency in Hz as 'u64'.\nMultiplying max frequency by 1000 can potentially result in overflow --\nmultiplying by 1000ULL instead should avoid that...\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static\nanalysis tool.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3c3edb82d67b2be9231174ac2af4af60d4af7549","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/904f881b57360cf85de962d84d8614d94431f60e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bb6d99e27cbe6b30e4e3bbd32927fd3b0bdec6eb","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d4955c0ad77dbc684fc716387070ac24801b8bca","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3c3edb82d67b2be9231174ac2af4af60d4af7549","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/904f881b57360cf85de962d84d8614d94431f60e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bb6d99e27cbe6b30e4e3bbd32927fd3b0bdec6eb","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d4955c0ad77dbc684fc716387070ac24801b8bca"]}
