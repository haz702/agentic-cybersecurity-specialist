{"id":"CVE-2023-27524","publishedDate":"2023-04-24T16:15:07.843","cvssV3":8.9,"description":"Session Validation attacks in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.0.1. Installations that have not altered the default configured SECRET_KEY according to installation instructions allow for an attacker to authenticate and access unauthorized resources. This does not affect Superset administrators who have changed the default value for SECRET_KEY config.\n\nAll superset installations should always set a unique secure random SECRET_KEY. Your SECRET_KEY is used to securely sign all session cookies and encrypting sensitive information on the database.\nAdd a strong SECRET_KEY to your `superset_config.py` file like:\n\nSECRET_KEY = <YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY>\n\nAlternatively you can set it with `SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.\n","references":["https://lists.apache.org/thread/n0ftx60sllf527j7g11kmt24wvof8xyk","https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172522/Apache-Superset-2.0.0-Authentication-Bypass.html","https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175094/Apache-Superset-2.0.0-Remote-Code-Execution.html","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/24/2","https://lists.apache.org/thread/n0ftx60sllf527j7g11kmt24wvof8xyk","https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172522/Apache-Superset-2.0.0-Authentication-Bypass.html","https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175094/Apache-Superset-2.0.0-Remote-Code-Execution.html","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/24/2"]}
