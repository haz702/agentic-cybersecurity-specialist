{"id":"CVE-2021-3978","publishedDate":"2025-01-29T10:15:07.750","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"When copying files with rsync, octorpki uses the \"-a\" flag 0, which forces rsync to copy binaries with the suid bit set as root. Since the provided service definition defaults to root ( https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/blob/master/package/octorpki.service ) this could allow for a vector, when combined with another vulnerability that causes octorpki to process a malicious TAL file, for a local privilege escalation.","references":["https://github.com/cloudflare/cfrpki/security/advisories/GHSA-3pqh-p72c-fj85"]}
