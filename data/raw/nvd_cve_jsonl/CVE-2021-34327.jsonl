{"id":"CVE-2021-34327","publishedDate":"2021-07-13T11:15:13.007","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2), Solid Edge SE2021 (All Versions < SE2021MP5), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2). The plmxmlAdapterSE70.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing ASM files. This could result in an out of bounds write past the fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
