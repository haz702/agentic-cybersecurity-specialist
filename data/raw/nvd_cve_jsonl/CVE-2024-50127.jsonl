{"id":"CVE-2024-50127","publishedDate":"2024-11-05T18:15:15.670","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: sched: fix use-after-free in taprio_change()\n\nIn 'taprio_change()', 'admin' pointer may become dangling due to sched\nswitch / removal caused by 'advance_sched()', and critical section\nprotected by 'q->current_entry_lock' is too small to prevent from such\na scenario (which causes use-after-free detected by KASAN). Fix this\nby prefer 'rcu_replace_pointer()' over 'rcu_assign_pointer()' to update\n'admin' immediately before an attempt to schedule freeing.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0d4c0d2844e4eac3aed647f948fd7e60eea56a61","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2240f9376f20f8b6463232b4ca7292569217237f","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2f868ce6013548a713c431c679ef73747a66fcf3","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8a283a19026aaae8a773fd8061263cfa315b127f","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/999612996df28d81f163dad530d7f8026e03aec6","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f504465970aebb2467da548f7c1efbbf36d0f44b","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fe371f084073e8672a2d7d46b335c3c060d1e301"]}
