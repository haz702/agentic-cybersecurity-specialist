{"id":"CVE-2020-26160","publishedDate":"2020-09-30T18:15:27.397","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations with []string{} for m[\"aud\"] (which is allowed by the specification). Because the type assertion fails, \"\" is the value of aud. This is a security problem if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.","references":["https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go/pull/426","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMDGRIJALVAJWTGO-596515","https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go/pull/426","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMDGRIJALVAJWTGO-596515"]}
