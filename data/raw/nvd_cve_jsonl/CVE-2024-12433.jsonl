{"id":"CVE-2024-12433","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:28.760","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A vulnerability in infiniflow/ragflow versions v0.12.0 allows for remote code execution. The RPC server in RagFlow uses a hard-coded AuthKey 'authkey=b'infiniflow-token4kevinhu'' which can be easily fetched by attackers to join the group communication without restrictions. Additionally, the server processes incoming data using pickle deserialization via `pickle.loads()` on `connection.recv()`, making it vulnerable to remote code execution. This issue is fixed in version 0.14.0.","references":["https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/commit/49494d4e3c8f06a5e52cf1f7cce9fa03cadcfbf6","https://huntr.com/bounties/8a1465af-09e4-42af-9e54-0b70e7c87499"]}
