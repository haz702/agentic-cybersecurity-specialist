NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the payload could only be entered by a trusted user, such as the owner of the server that hosts Winter CMS, or a developer working for them.","references":["https://forum.ksec.co.uk/t/webapps-winter-cms-1-2-3-server-side-template-injection-ssti-authenticated/2779","https://wintercms.com/docs/v1.2/docs/cms/themes#template-structure","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51893","https://forum.ksec.co.uk/t/webapps-winter-cms-1-2-3-server-side-template-injection-ssti-authenticated/2779","https://wintercms.com/docs/v1.2/docs/cms/themes#template-structure","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51893"]}
