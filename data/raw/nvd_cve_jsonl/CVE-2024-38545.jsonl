When CQ asynchronous\nevents and CQ destruction are concurrent, CQ may have been released,\nwhich will cause UAF.\n\nUse the xa_lock() to protect the CQ refcount.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/330c825e66ef65278e4ebe57fd49c1d6f3f4e34e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/37a7559dc1358a8d300437e99ed8ecdab0671507","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39d26cf46306bdc7ae809ecfdbfeff5aa1098911","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/63da190eeb5c9d849b71f457b15b308c94cbaf08","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/763780ef0336a973e933e40e919339381732dcaf","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a942ec2745ca864cd8512142100e4027dc306a42","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/37a7559dc1358a8d300437e99ed8ecdab0671507","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39d26cf46306bdc7ae809ecfdbfeff5aa1098911","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/63da190eeb5c9d849b71f457b15b308c94cbaf08","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/763780ef0336a973e933e40e919339381732dcaf","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a942ec2745ca864cd8512142100e4027dc306a42"]}
