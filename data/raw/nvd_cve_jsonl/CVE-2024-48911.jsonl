{"id":"CVE-2024-48911","publishedDate":"2024-10-14T21:15:12.323","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"OpenCanary, a multi-protocol network honeypot, directly executed commands taken from its config file. Prior to version 0.9.4, where the config file is stored in an unprivileged user directory but the daemon is executed by root, it\u2019s possible for the unprivileged user to change the config file and escalate permissions when root later runs the daemon. Version 0.9.4 contains a fix for the issue.","references":["https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary/commit/2c11575b1a3dd8b0df26a879ba856c0aa350c049","https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary/releases/tag/v0.9.4","https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary/security/advisories/GHSA-pf5v-pqfv-x8jj"]}
