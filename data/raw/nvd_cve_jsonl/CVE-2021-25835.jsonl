{"id":"CVE-2021-25835","publishedDate":"2021-02-08T18:15:13.803","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Cosmos Network Ethermint <= v0.4.0 is affected by a cross-chain transaction replay vulnerability in the EVM module. Since ethermint uses the same chainIDEpoch and signature schemes with ethereum for compatibility, a verified signature in ethereum is still valid in ethermint with the same msg content and chainIDEpoch, which enables \"cross-chain transaction replay\" attack.","references":["https://github.com/cosmos/ethermint/issues/687","https://github.com/cosmos/ethermint/pull/692","https://github.com/cosmos/ethermint/issues/687","https://github.com/cosmos/ethermint/pull/692"]}
