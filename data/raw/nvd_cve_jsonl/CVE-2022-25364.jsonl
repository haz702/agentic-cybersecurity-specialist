{"id":"CVE-2022-25364","publishedDate":"2022-03-17T17:15:07.550","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"In Gradle Enterprise before 2021.4.2, the default built-in build cache configuration allowed anonymous write access. If this was not manually changed, a malicious actor with network access to the build cache could potentially populate it with manipulated entries that execute malicious code as part of a build. As of 2021.4.2, the built-in build cache is inaccessible-by-default, requiring explicit configuration of its access-control settings before it can be used. (Remote build cache nodes are unaffected as they are inaccessible-by-default.)","references":["https://security.gradle.com","https://security.gradle.com/advisory/2022-02","https://security.gradle.com","https://security.gradle.com/advisory/2022-02"]}
