{"id":"CVE-2024-8642","publishedDate":"2024-09-11T14:15:14.177","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"In Eclipse Dataspace Components, from version 0.5.0 and before version 0.9.0, the ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController does not check for token validity (expiry, not-before, issuance date), which can allow an attacker to bypass the check for token expiration. The issue requires to have a dataplane configured to support http proxy consumer pull AND include the module \"transfer-data-plane\". The affected code was marked deprecated from the version 0.6.0 in favour of Dataplane Signaling. In 0.9.0 the vulnerable code has been removed.","references":["https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/commit/04899e91dcdb4a407db4eb7af3e7b6ff9a9e9ad6","https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/releases/tag/v0.9.0","https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/28","https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/234"]}
