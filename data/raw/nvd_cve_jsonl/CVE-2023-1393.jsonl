{"id":"CVE-2023-1393","publishedDate":"2023-03-30T21:15:06.557","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A flaw was found in X.Org Server Overlay Window. A Use-After-Free may lead to local privilege escalation. If a client explicitly destroys the compositor overlay window (aka COW), the Xserver would leave a dangling pointer to that window in the CompScreen structure, which will trigger a use-after-free later.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/commit/26ef545b3502f61ca722a7a3373507e88ef64110","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BPNQYHUI63DB5FHK6EOI3Z4C6YQZGZKI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/H3EVO3OQV6T4BSABWZ2TU3PY5TJTEQZ2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MEHSYYFGBN3G4RS2HJXKQ5NBMOAZ5F2F/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NOYATGGPMT3COC7ELAJW5TG2PVS3AFR2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PSAAGI5V77FQXIT5PP4URP6BYQVCK5U5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QHJMSMK7G4GPLMKIGKXIOL2RTKU5VFWE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SW2NRC3V53PIBXFPFBVWCOM2MDDILWQS/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SWFUDSBSABRHQOX6TIQ5O3SNPFTPFQQP/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-30","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/03/29/1","https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/commit/26ef545b3502f61ca722a7a3373507e88ef64110","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BPNQYHUI63DB5FHK6EOI3Z4C6YQZGZKI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/H3EVO3OQV6T4BSABWZ2TU3PY5TJTEQZ2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MEHSYYFGBN3G4RS2HJXKQ5NBMOAZ5F2F/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NOYATGGPMT3COC7ELAJW5TG2PVS3AFR2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PSAAGI5V77FQXIT5PP4URP6BYQVCK5U5/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QHJMSMK7G4GPLMKIGKXIOL2RTKU5VFWE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SW2NRC3V53PIBXFPFBVWCOM2MDDILWQS/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SWFUDSBSABRHQOX6TIQ5O3SNPFTPFQQP/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-30","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/03/29/1"]}
