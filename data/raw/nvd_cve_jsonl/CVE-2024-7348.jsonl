{"id":"CVE-2024-7348","publishedDate":"2024-08-08T13:15:14.007","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows an object creator to execute arbitrary SQL functions as the user running pg_dump, which is often a superuser. The attack involves replacing another relation type with a view or foreign table. The attack requires waiting for pg_dump to start, but winning the race condition is trivial if the attacker retains an open transaction. Versions before PostgreSQL 16.4, 15.8, 14.13, 13.16, and 12.20 are affected.","references":["https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-7348/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/11/1","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240822-0002/"]}
