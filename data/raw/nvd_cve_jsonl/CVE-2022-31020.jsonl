{"id":"CVE-2022-31020","publishedDate":"2022-09-06T17:15:08.220","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In versions 1.12.4 and prior, the `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node allows an improperly authenticated attacker to remotely execute code on nodes within the network. The `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node 1.12.5 has been updated to properly authenticate pool-upgrade transactions before any processing is performed by the request handler. The transactions are further sanitized to prevent remote code execution. As a workaround, endorsers should not create DIDs for untrusted users. A vulnerable ledger should configure `auth_rules` to prevent new DIDs from being written to the ledger until the network can be upgraded.","references":["https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/commit/fe507474f77084faef4539101e2bbb4d508a97f5","https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/releases/tag/v1.12.5","https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/security/advisories/GHSA-r6v9-p59m-gj2p","https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/commit/fe507474f77084faef4539101e2bbb4d508a97f5","https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/releases/tag/v1.12.5","https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/security/advisories/GHSA-r6v9-p59m-gj2p"]}
