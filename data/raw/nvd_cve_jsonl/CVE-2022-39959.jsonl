{"id":"CVE-2022-39959","publishedDate":"2022-10-07T22:15:12.240","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Panini Everest Engine 2.0.4 allows unprivileged users to create a file named Everest.exe in the %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini folder. This leads to privilege escalation because a service, running as SYSTEM, uses the unquoted path of %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini\\Everest Engine\\EverestEngine.exe and therefore a Trojan horse %PROGRAMDATA%\\Panini\\Everest.exe may be executed instead of the intended vendor-supplied EverestEngine.exe file.","references":["https://github.com/usmarine2141/CVE-2022-39959","https://www.panini.com/en/news-events/panini-patents-revolutionary-new-%E2%80%9Ceverest%E2%80%9D-architecture","https://github.com/usmarine2141/CVE-2022-39959","https://www.panini.com/en/news-events/panini-patents-revolutionary-new-%E2%80%9Ceverest%E2%80%9D-architecture"]}
