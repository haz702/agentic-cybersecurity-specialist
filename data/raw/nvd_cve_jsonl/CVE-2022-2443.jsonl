{"id":"CVE-2022-2443","publishedDate":"2022-07-18T17:15:09.307","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The FreeMind WP Browser plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.2. This is due to missing nonce protection on the FreemindOptions() function found in the ~/freemind-wp-browser.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the page, granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/freemind-wp-browser/trunk/freemind-wp-browser.php#L104","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c5f3e34d-07fb-4e49-a4e2-f8e92301b35e?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2443","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/freemind-wp-browser/trunk/freemind-wp-browser.php#L104","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c5f3e34d-07fb-4e49-a4e2-f8e92301b35e?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2443"]}
