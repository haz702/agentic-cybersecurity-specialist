{"id":"CVE-2024-38499","publishedDate":"2024-12-17T06:15:20.760","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"CA Client Automation (ITCM) allows non-admin/non-root users to encrypt a string using CAF CLI and SD_ACMD CLI. This would allow the non admin user to access the critical encryption keys which further causes the exploitation of stored credentials. This fix doesn't allow a non-admin/non-root user to execute \"caf encrypt\"/\"sd_acmd encrypt\" commands.","references":["https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/25284","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Dec/16"]}
