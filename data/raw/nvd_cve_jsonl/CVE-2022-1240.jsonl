{"id":"CVE-2022-1240","publishedDate":"2022-04-06T11:15:07.587","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Heap buffer overflow in libr/bin/format/mach0/mach0.c in GitHub repository radareorg/radare2 prior to 5.8.6. If address sanitizer is disabled during the compiling, the program should executes into the `r_str_ncpy` function. Therefore I think it is very likely to be exploitable. For more general description of heap buffer overflow, see [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html).","references":["https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/commit/ca8d8b39f3e34a4fd943270330b80f1148129de4","https://huntr.dev/bounties/e589bd97-4c74-4e79-93b5-0951a281facc","https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/commit/ca8d8b39f3e34a4fd943270330b80f1148129de4","https://huntr.dev/bounties/e589bd97-4c74-4e79-93b5-0951a281facc"]}
