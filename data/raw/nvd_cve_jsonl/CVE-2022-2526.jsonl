{"id":"CVE-2022-2526","publishedDate":"2022-09-09T15:15:10.107","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd. This issue occurs due to the on_stream_io() function and dns_stream_complete() function in 'resolved-dns-stream.c' not incrementing the reference counting for the DnsStream object. Therefore, other functions and callbacks called can dereference the DNSStream object, causing the use-after-free when the reference is still used later.","references":["https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/d973d94dec349fb676fdd844f6fe2ada3538f27c","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221111-0005/","https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/d973d94dec349fb676fdd844f6fe2ada3538f27c","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221111-0005/"]}
