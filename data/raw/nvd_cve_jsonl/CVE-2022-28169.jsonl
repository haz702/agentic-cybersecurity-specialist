{"id":"CVE-2022-28169","publishedDate":"2022-10-25T21:15:38.813","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Brocade Webtools in Brocade Fabric OS versions before Brocade Fabric OS versions v9.1.1, v9.0.1e, and v8.2.3c could allow a low privilege webtools, user, to gain elevated admin rights, or privileges, beyond what is intended or entitled for that user. By exploiting this vulnerability, a user whose role is not an admin can create a new user with an admin role using the operator session id. The issue was replicated after intercepting the admin, and operator authorization headers sent unencrypted and editing a user addition request to use the operator's authorization header.","references":["https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230127-0001/","https://www.broadcom.com/support/fibre-channel-networking/security-advisories/brocade-security-advisory-2022-2075","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230127-0001/","https://www.broadcom.com/support/fibre-channel-networking/security-advisories/brocade-security-advisory-2022-2075"]}
