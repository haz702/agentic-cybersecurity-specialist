This occurs because of a TOCTOU race condition associated with a VMCB12 double fetch in nested_svm_vmrun.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163324/KVM-nested_svm_vmrun-Double-Fetch.html","https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2177","https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.11.12","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a58d9166a756a0f4a6618e4f593232593d6df134","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210902-0008/","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163324/KVM-nested_svm_vmrun-Double-Fetch.html","https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2177","https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.11.12","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a58d9166a756a0f4a6618e4f593232593d6df134","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210902-0008/"]}
