{"id":"CVE-2022-39215","publishedDate":"2022-09-15T22:15:11.527","cvssV3":8.3,"description":"Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link or junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could be leaked. The issue has been resolved in version 1.0.6 and the implementation now properly checks if the requested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the `readDir` endpoint in the `allowlist` inside the `tauri.conf.json`.","references":["https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4882","https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123","https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123/commits/1f9b9e8d26a2c915390323e161020bcb36d44678","https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-28m8-9j7v-x499","https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4882","https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123","https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123/commits/1f9b9e8d26a2c915390323e161020bcb36d44678","https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-28m8-9j7v-x499"]}
