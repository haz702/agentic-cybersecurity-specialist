{"id":"CVE-2021-37706","publishedDate":"2021-12-22T18:15:07.487","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the header length is not checked before performing a subtraction operation, potentially resulting in an integer underflow scenario. This issue affects all users that use STUN. A malicious actor located within the victim\u2019s network may forge and send a specially crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary code on the victim\u2019s machine. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166225/Asterisk-Project-Security-Advisory-AST-2022-004.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Mar/0","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/15663e3f37091069b8c98a7fce680dc04bc8e865","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-2qpg-f6wf-w984","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166225/Asterisk-Project-Security-Advisory-AST-2022-004.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Mar/0","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/15663e3f37091069b8c98a7fce680dc04bc8e865","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-2qpg-f6wf-w984","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285"]}
