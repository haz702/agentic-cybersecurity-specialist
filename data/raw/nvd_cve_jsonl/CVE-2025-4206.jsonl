{"id":"CVE-2025-4206","publishedDate":"2025-05-09T12:15:33.513","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The WordPress CRM, Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award Winner \u2014 Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'process_export_delete' and 'process_import_delete' functions in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/groundhogg/trunk/admin/tools/tools-page.php#L701","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/groundhogg/trunk/admin/tools/tools-page.php#L912","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3289364/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0256b4ad-6094-4062-bdf7-c3fc0410557b?source=cve"]}
