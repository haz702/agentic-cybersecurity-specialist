{"id":"CVE-2020-36317","publishedDate":"2021-04-11T20:15:12.390","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In the standard library in Rust before 1.49.0, String::retain() function has a panic safety problem. It allows creation of a non-UTF-8 Rust string when the provided closure panics. This bug could result in a memory safety violation when other string APIs assume that UTF-8 encoding is used on the same string.","references":["https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78498","https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78499","https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78498","https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78499"]}
