{"id":"CVE-2023-4208","publishedDate":"2023-09-06T14:15:11.627","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_u32 component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nWhen u32_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81","https://kernel.dance/3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5492","https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81","https://kernel.dance/3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5492"]}
