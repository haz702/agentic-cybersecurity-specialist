{"id":"CVE-2024-39720","publishedDate":"2024-10-31T20:15:04.877","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"An issue was discovered in Ollama before 0.1.46. An attacker can use two HTTP requests to upload a malformed GGUF file containing just 4 bytes starting with the GGUF custom magic header. By leveraging a custom Modelfile that includes a FROM statement pointing to the attacker-controlled blob file, the attacker can crash the application through the CreateModel route, leading to a segmentation fault (signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation).","references":["https://github.com/ollama/ollama/compare/v0.1.45...v0.1.46#diff-782c2737eecfa83b7cb46a77c8bdaf40023e7067baccd4f806ac5517b4563131L417","https://oligo.security/blog/more-models-more-probllms"]}
