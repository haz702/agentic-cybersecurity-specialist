{"id":"CVE-2024-3166","publishedDate":"2024-06-06T19:16:00.817","cvssV3":9.6,"description":"A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in mintplex-labs/anything-llm, affecting both the desktop application version 1.2.0 and the latest version of the web application. The vulnerability arises from the application's feature to fetch and embed content from websites into workspaces, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. In the desktop application, this flaw can be escalated to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insecure application settings, specifically the enabling of 'nodeIntegration' and the disabling of 'contextIsolation' in Electron's webPreferences. The issue has been addressed in version 1.4.2 of the desktop application.","references":["https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/fa27103d032c58904c49b92ee13fabc19a20a5ce","https://huntr.com/bounties/af288bd3-8824-4216-a294-ae9fb444e5db","https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/fa27103d032c58904c49b92ee13fabc19a20a5ce","https://huntr.com/bounties/af288bd3-8824-4216-a294-ae9fb444e5db"]}
