{"id":"CVE-2022-36085","publishedDate":"2022-09-08T14:15:08.340","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine. The Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe \u2014 and as such rejected \u2014 by the compiler if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this protection has been found, where the use of the `with` keyword to mock such a built-in function (a feature introduced in OPA v0.40.0), isn\u2019t taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`. Multiple conditions need to be met in order to create an adverse effect. Version 0.43.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using the `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function and use the `capabilities` feature instead.","references":["https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/25a597bc3f4985162e7f65f9c36599f4f8f55823","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/3e8c754ed007b22393cf65e48751ad9f6457fee8","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4540","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4616","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/tag/v0.43.1","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/security/advisories/GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/25a597bc3f4985162e7f65f9c36599f4f8f55823","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/3e8c754ed007b22393cf65e48751ad9f6457fee8","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4540","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4616","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/tag/v0.43.1","https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/security/advisories/GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr"]}
