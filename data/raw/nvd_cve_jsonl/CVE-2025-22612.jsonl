{"id":"CVE-2025-22612","publishedDate":"2025-01-24T17:15:15.570","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.374, the missing authorization allows an authenticated user to retrieve any existing private keys on a coolify instance in plain text. If the server configuration of IP / domain, port (most likely 22) and user (root) matches with the victim's server configuration, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the remote server. Version 4.0.0-beta.374 fixes the issue.","references":["https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/security/advisories/GHSA-wg8x-cgq4-vjxj"]}
