{"id":"CVE-2024-7012","publishedDate":"2024-09-04T14:15:14.570","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Foreman when deployed with External Authentication, due to the puppet-foreman configuration. This issue arises from Apache's mod_proxy not properly unsetting headers because of restrictions on underscores in HTTP headers, allowing authentication through a malformed header. This flaw impacts all active Satellite deployments (6.13, 6.14 and 6.15) and could potentially enable unauthorized users to gain administrative access.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6335","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6336","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6337","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:8906","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7012","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2299429"]}
