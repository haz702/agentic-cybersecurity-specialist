{"id":"CVE-2020-6012","publishedDate":"2020-08-04T14:15:11.927","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware before version 1.0.713 copies files for the report from a directory with low privileges. A sophisticated timed attacker can replace those files with malicious or linked content, such as exploiting CVE-2020-0896 on unpatched systems or using symbolic links. This allows an unprivileged user to enable escalation of privilege via local access.","references":["https://danishcyberdefence.dk/blog/zonealarm-check-point","https://www.zonealarm.com/anti-ransomware/release-history","https://www.zonealarm.com/software/extreme-security/release-history","https://danishcyberdefence.dk/blog/zonealarm-check-point","https://www.zonealarm.com/anti-ransomware/release-history","https://www.zonealarm.com/software/extreme-security/release-history"]}
