{"id":"CVE-2024-42355","publishedDate":"2024-08-08T15:15:18.013","cvssV3":8.3,"description":"Shopware, an open ecommerce platform, has a new Twig Tag `sw_silent_feature_call` which silences deprecation messages while triggered in this tag. Prior to versions 6.6.5.1 and 6.5.8.13, it accepts as parameter a string the feature flag name to silence, but this parameter is not escaped properly and allows execution of code. Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13 to receive a patch. For older versions of 6.2, 6.3,  and 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin.","references":["https://github.com/shopware/core/commit/a784aa1cec0624e36e0ee4d41aeebaed40e0442f","https://github.com/shopware/core/commit/d35ee2eda5c995faeb08b3dad127eab65c64e2a2","https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/445c6763cc093fbd651e0efaa4150deae4ae60da","https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/8504ba7e56e53add6a1d5b9d45015e3d899cd0ac","https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-27wp-jvhw-v4xp"]}
