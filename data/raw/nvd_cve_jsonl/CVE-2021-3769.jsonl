{"id":"CVE-2021-3769","publishedDate":"2021-11-30T10:15:09.000","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"# Vulnerability in `pygmalion`, `pygmalion-virtualenv` and `refined` themes **Description**: these themes use `print -P` on user-supplied strings to print them to the terminal. All of them do that on git information, particularly the branch name, so if the branch has a specially-crafted name the vulnerability can be exploited. **Fixed in**: [b3ba9978](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/commit/b3ba9978). **Impacted areas**: - `pygmalion` theme. - `pygmalion-virtualenv` theme. - `refined` theme.","references":["https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/commit/b3ba9978","https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/commit/b3ba9978"]}
