{"id":"CVE-2024-9053","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:46.327","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"vllm-project vllm version 0.6.0 contains a vulnerability in the AsyncEngineRPCServer() RPC server entrypoints. The core functionality run_server_loop() calls the function _make_handler_coro(), which directly uses cloudpickle.loads() on received messages without any sanitization. This can result in remote code execution by deserializing malicious pickle data.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/75a544f3-34a3-4da0-b5a3-1495cb031e09"]}
