{"id":"CVE-2024-1522","publishedDate":"2024-03-30T18:15:45.930","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms-webui project allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system. The vulnerability stems from the `/execute_code` API endpoint, which does not properly validate requests, enabling an attacker to craft a malicious webpage that, when visited by a victim, submits a form to the victim's local lollms-webui instance to execute arbitrary OS commands. This issue allows attackers to take full control of the victim's system without requiring direct network access to the vulnerable application.","references":["https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/commit/0b51063119cfb5e391925d232a4af1de9dc32e2b","https://huntr.com/bounties/687cef92-3432-4d6c-af92-868eccabbb71","https://github.com/parisneo/lollms-webui/commit/0b51063119cfb5e391925d232a4af1de9dc32e2b","https://huntr.com/bounties/687cef92-3432-4d6c-af92-868eccabbb71"]}
