{"id":"CVE-2024-22416","publishedDate":"2024-01-18T00:15:38.397","cvssV3":9.6,"description":"pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. As a result any API call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user. This issue has been addressed in release `0.5.0b3.dev78`. All users are advised to upgrade.","references":["https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/1374c824271cb7e927740664d06d2e577624ca3e","https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/c7cdc18ad9134a75222974b39e8b427c4af845fc","https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-pgpj-v85q-h5fm","https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/1374c824271cb7e927740664d06d2e577624ca3e","https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/c7cdc18ad9134a75222974b39e8b427c4af845fc","https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-pgpj-v85q-h5fm"]}
