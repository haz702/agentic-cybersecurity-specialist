{"id":"CVE-2023-52169","publishedDate":"2024-07-03T18:15:04.677","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"The NtfsHandler.cpp NTFS handler in 7-Zip before 24.01 (for 7zz) contains an out-of-bounds read that allows an attacker to read beyond the intended buffer. The bytes read beyond the intended buffer are presented as a part of a filename listed in the file system image. This has security relevance in some known web-service use cases where untrusted users can upload files and have them extracted by a server-side 7-Zip process.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/03/10","https://dfir.ru/2024/06/19/vulnerabilities-in-7-zip-and-ntfs3/","https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2402/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/03/10","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/03/10","https://dfir.ru/2024/06/19/vulnerabilities-in-7-zip-and-ntfs3/","https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2402/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/03/10"]}
