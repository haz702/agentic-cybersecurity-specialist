{"id":"CVE-2021-20206","publishedDate":"2021-03-26T22:15:12.617","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"An improper limitation of path name flaw was found in containernetworking/cni in versions before 0.8.1. When specifying the plugin to load in the 'type' field in the network configuration, it is possible to use special elements such as \"../\" separators to reference binaries elsewhere on the system. This flaw allows an attacker to execute other existing binaries other than the cni plugins/types, such as 'reboot'. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1919391","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMCONTAINERNETWORKINGCNIPKGINVOKE-1070549","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1919391","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMCONTAINERNETWORKINGCNIPKGINVOKE-1070549"]}
