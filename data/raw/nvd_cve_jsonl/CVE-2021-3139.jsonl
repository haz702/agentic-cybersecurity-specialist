{"id":"CVE-2021-3139","publishedDate":"2021-01-13T16:15:14.617","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"In Open-iSCSI tcmu-runner 1.3.x, 1.4.x, and 1.5.x through 1.5.2, xcopy_locate_udev in tcmur_cmd_handler.c lacks a check for transport-layer restrictions, allowing remote attackers to read or write files via directory traversal in an XCOPY request. For example, an attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN. NOTE: relative to CVE-2020-28374, this is a similar mistake in a different algorithm.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/13/5","https://bugzilla.suse.com/attachment.cgi?id=844938","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178372","https://github.com/open-iscsi/tcmu-runner/pull/644","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/12/12","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/13/5","https://bugzilla.suse.com/attachment.cgi?id=844938","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178372","https://github.com/open-iscsi/tcmu-runner/pull/644","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/12/12"]}
