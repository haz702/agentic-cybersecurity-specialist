{"id":"CVE-2022-45939","publishedDate":"2022-11-28T06:15:10.563","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell metacharacters in the name of a source-code file, because lib-src/etags.c uses the system C library function in its implementation of the ctags program. For example, a victim may use the \"ctags *\" command (suggested in the ctags documentation) in a situation where the current working directory has contents that depend on untrusted input.","references":["https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=d48bb4874bc6cd3e69c7a15fc3c91cc141025c51","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00046.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FOSK3J7BBAEI4IITW2DRUKLQYUZYKH6Y/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GOXIH2FDEQJEAARE52C3GHTLGQFBYPIB/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5314","https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=d48bb4874bc6cd3e69c7a15fc3c91cc141025c51","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00046.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FOSK3J7BBAEI4IITW2DRUKLQYUZYKH6Y/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GOXIH2FDEQJEAARE52C3GHTLGQFBYPIB/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5314"]}
