{"id":"CVE-2025-24359","publishedDate":"2025-01-24T17:15:16.197","cvssV3":8.4,"description":"ASTEVAL is an evaluator of Python expressions and statements. Prior to version 1.0.6, if an attacker can control the input to the `asteval` library, they can bypass asteval's restrictions and execute arbitrary Python code in the context of the application using the library. The vulnerability is rooted in how `asteval` performs handling of `FormattedValue` AST nodes. In particular, the `on_formattedvalue` value uses the dangerous format method of the str class. The code allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the string used in the dangerous call `fmt.format(__fstring__=val)`. This vulnerability can be exploited to access protected attributes by intentionally triggering an `AttributeError` exception. The attacker can then catch the exception and use its `obj` attribute to gain arbitrary access to sensitive or protected object properties. Version 1.0.6 fixes this issue.","references":["https://github.com/lmfit/asteval/blob/cfb57f0beebe0dc0520a1fbabc35e66060c7ea71/asteval/asteval.py#L507","https://github.com/lmfit/asteval/security/advisories/GHSA-3wwr-3g9f-9gc7","https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format"]}
