{"id":"CVE-2024-36477","publishedDate":"2024-06-21T12:15:11.040","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntpm_tis_spi: Account for SPI header when allocating TPM SPI xfer buffer\n\nThe TPM SPI transfer mechanism uses MAX_SPI_FRAMESIZE for computing the\nmaximum transfer length and the size of the transfer buffer. As such, it\ndoes not account for the 4 bytes of header that prepends the SPI data\nframe. This can result in out-of-bounds accesses and was confirmed with\nKASAN.\n\nIntroduce SPI_HDRSIZE to account for the header and use to allocate the\ntransfer buffer.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1547183852dcdfcc25878db7dd3620509217b0cd","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/195aba96b854dd664768f382cd1db375d8181f88","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/de13c56f99477b56980c7e00b09c776d16b7563d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1547183852dcdfcc25878db7dd3620509217b0cd","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/195aba96b854dd664768f382cd1db375d8181f88","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/de13c56f99477b56980c7e00b09c776d16b7563d"]}
