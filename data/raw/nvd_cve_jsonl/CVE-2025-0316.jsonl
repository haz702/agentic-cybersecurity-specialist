This is due to incorrect authentication in the 'wp_dp_enquiry_agent_contact_form_submit_callback' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/directory-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/10480929","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3ee1f412-7555-4dec-ba59-49412471a42f?source=cve"]}
