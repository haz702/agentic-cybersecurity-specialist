It was found that the authentication check for those ONVIF operations can be bypassed. An attacker can abuse this issue to execute privileged operations without authentication, for instance, to create a new Administrator user.","references":["https://ioac.tv/3hy1xu6","https://ioactive.com/moog-exo-series-multiple-vulnerabilities/","https://ioac.tv/3hy1xu6","https://ioactive.com/moog-exo-series-multiple-vulnerabilities/"]}
