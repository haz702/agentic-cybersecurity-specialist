{"id":"CVE-2020-24264","publishedDate":"2021-03-16T15:15:12.607","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Portainer 1.24.1 and earlier is affected by incorrect access control that may lead to remote arbitrary code execution. The restriction checks for bind mounts are applied only on the client-side and not the server-side, which can lead to spawning a container with bind mount. Once such a container is spawned, it can be leveraged to break out of the container leading to complete Docker host machine takeover.","references":["https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4106","https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4106"]}
