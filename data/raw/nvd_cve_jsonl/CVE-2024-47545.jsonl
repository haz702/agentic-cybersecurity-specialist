{"id":"CVE-2024-47545","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:29.083","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in qtdemux_parse_trak function within qtdemux.c. During the strf parsing case, the subtraction size -= 40 can lead to a negative integer overflow if it is less than 40. If this happens, the subsequent call to gst_buffer_fill will invoke memcpy with a large tocopy size, resulting in an OOB-read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8059.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0010.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-242_Gstreamer/"]}
