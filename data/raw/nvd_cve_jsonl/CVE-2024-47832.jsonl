{"id":"CVE-2024-47832","publishedDate":"2024-10-09T19:15:14.647","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"ssoready is a single sign on provider implemented via docker. Affected versions are vulnerable to XML signature bypass attacks. An attacker can carry out signature bypass if you have access to certain IDP-signed messages. The underlying mechanism exploits differential behavior between XML parsers. Users of https://ssoready.com, the public hosted instance of SSOReady, are unaffected. We advise folks who self-host SSOReady to upgrade to 7f92a06 or later. Do so by updating your SSOReady Docker images from sha-... to sha-7f92a06. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","references":["https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/commit/7f92a0630439972fcbefa8c7eafe8c144bd89915","https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/security/advisories/GHSA-j2hr-q93x-gxvh","https://ssoready.com/docs/self-hosting/self-hosting-sso-ready"]}
