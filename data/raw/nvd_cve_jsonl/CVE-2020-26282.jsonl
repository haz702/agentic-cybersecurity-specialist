{"id":"CVE-2020-26282","publishedDate":"2020-12-24T21:15:12.727","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"BrowserUp Proxy allows you to manipulate HTTP requests and responses, capture HTTP content, and export performance data as a HAR file. BrowserUp Proxy works well as a standalone proxy server, but it is especially useful when embedded in Selenium tests. A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in BrowserUp Proxy enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. This has been patched in version 2.1.2.","references":["https://github.com/browserup/browserup-proxy/commit/4b38e7a3e20917e5c3329d0d4e9590bed9d578ab","https://github.com/browserup/browserup-proxy/releases/tag/v2.1.2","https://github.com/browserup/browserup-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-wmfg-55f9-j8hq","https://securitylab.github.com/research/bean-validation-RCE","https://github.com/browserup/browserup-proxy/commit/4b38e7a3e20917e5c3329d0d4e9590bed9d578ab","https://github.com/browserup/browserup-proxy/releases/tag/v2.1.2","https://github.com/browserup/browserup-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-wmfg-55f9-j8hq","https://securitylab.github.com/research/bean-validation-RCE"]}
