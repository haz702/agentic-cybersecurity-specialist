{"id":"CVE-2024-10932","publishedDate":"2025-01-04T08:15:05.713","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.6 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'recursive_unserialize_replace' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must create a staging site in order to trigger the exploit.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser//backup-backup/tags/1.4.6/includes/database/search-replace.php#L46","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/backup-backup/tags/1.4.6.1/includes/database/search-replace.php#L46","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d5a0c514-5200-47f4-9d2e-684d68946b9a?source=cve"]}
