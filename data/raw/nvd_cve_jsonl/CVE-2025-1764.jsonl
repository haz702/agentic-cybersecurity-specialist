{"id":"CVE-2025-1764","publishedDate":"2025-03-14T06:15:24.860","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The LoginPress | wp-login Custom Login Page Customizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.3.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'custom_plugin_set_option' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. The 'WPBRIGADE_SDK__DEV_MODE' constant must be set to 'true' to exploit the vulnerability.","references":["https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/loginpress/trunk/lib/wpb-sdk/views/wpb-debug.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3253283/","https://pt.wordpress.org/plugins/loginpress/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9df6a2b4-2dc4-43dd-8282-5c05b0fa13f6?source=cve"]}
