{"id":"CVE-2023-0080","publishedDate":"2023-02-13T15:15:20.487","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce WordPress plugin before 5.16.0 does not validate one of its shortcode attribute, which could allow users with a contributor role and above to include arbitrary files via a traversal attack. This could also allow them to read non PHP files and retrieve their content. RCE could also be achieved if the attacker manage to upload a malicious image containing PHP code, and then include it via the affected attribute, on a default WP install, authors could easily achieve that given that they have the upload_file capability.","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/6b0d63ed-e244-4f20-8f10-a6e0c7ccadd4","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/6b0d63ed-e244-4f20-8f10-a6e0c7ccadd4"]}
