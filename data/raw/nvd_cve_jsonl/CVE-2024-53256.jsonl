{"id":"CVE-2024-53256","publishedDate":"2024-12-23T16:15:06.797","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. `rizin.c` still had an old snippet of code which suffered a command injection due the usage of `rz_core_cmdf` to invoke the command `m` which was removed in v0.1.x. A malicious binary defining `bclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is executed if `rclass` (part of RzBinInfo) is set to `fs`; the vulnerability can be exploited by any bin format where `bclass` and `rclass` are user defined. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.7.4.","references":["https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/be24ca8879ed9c58f288bdf21c271b6294720da4/librz/main/rizin.c#L1275-L1278","https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/db6c5b39c065ce719f587c9815c47fbb834b10fa","https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/security/advisories/GHSA-5jhc-frm4-p8v9"]}
