{"id":"CVE-2024-0439","publishedDate":"2024-02-26T16:27:50.490","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"As a manager, you should not be able to modify a series of settings. In the UI this is indeed hidden as a convenience for the role since most managers would not be savvy enough to modify these settings. They can use their token to still modify those settings though through a standard HTTP request\n\nWhile this is not a critical vulnerability, it does indeed need to be patched to enforce the expected permission level.","references":["https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/7200a06ef07d92eef5f3c4c8be29824aa001d688","https://huntr.com/bounties/7fc1b78e-7faf-4f40-961d-61e53dac81ce","https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/7200a06ef07d92eef5f3c4c8be29824aa001d688","https://huntr.com/bounties/7fc1b78e-7faf-4f40-961d-61e53dac81ce"]}
