{"id":"CVE-2022-28321","publishedDate":"2022-09-19T22:15:10.913","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Linux-PAM package before 1.5.2-6.1 for openSUSE Tumbleweed allows authentication bypass for SSH logins. The pam_access.so module doesn't correctly restrict login if a user tries to connect from an IP address that is not resolvable via DNS. In such conditions, a user with denied access to a machine can still get access. NOTE: the relevance of this issue is largely limited to openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory; it does not affect Linux-PAM upstream.","references":["http://download.opensuse.org/source/distribution/openSUSE-current/repo/oss/src/","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1197654","https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-28321.html","http://download.opensuse.org/source/distribution/openSUSE-current/repo/oss/src/","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1197654","https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-28321.html"]}
