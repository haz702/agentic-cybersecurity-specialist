{"id":"CVE-2023-35926","publishedDate":"2023-06-22T14:15:09.607","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. The Backstage scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that requires sandbox, as it by design allows for code injection. The library used for this sandbox so far has been `vm2`, but in light of several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities  that may not have a fix, the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox library. A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not by user input data. This is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.","references":["https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/fb7375507d56faedcb7bb3665480070593c8949a","https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/v1.15.0","https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-wg6p-jmpc-xjmr","https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/fb7375507d56faedcb7bb3665480070593c8949a","https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/v1.15.0","https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-wg6p-jmpc-xjmr"]}
