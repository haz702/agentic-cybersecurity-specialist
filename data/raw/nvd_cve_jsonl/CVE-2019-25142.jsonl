{"id":"CVE-2019-25142","publishedDate":"2023-06-07T02:15:10.250","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Mesmerize & Materialis themes for WordPress are vulnerable to authenticated options change in versions up to, and including,1.6.89 (Mesmerize) and 1.0.172 (Materialis). This is due to 'companion_disable_popup' function only checking the nonce while sending user input to the 'update_option' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to change otherwise restricted options.","references":["https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-mesmerize-and-materialis-themes-fixed-an-authenticated-options-change-vulnerability/","https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=121290%40materialis&new=121290%40materialis&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=121291%40mesmerize&new=121291%40mesmerize&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://wordpress.org/themes/materialis/","https://wordpress.org/themes/mesmerize/","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/e4d70f03-69d5-4cca-8300-985f68d19ddc","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8c9c3302-47cd-4dbe-b79e-5e6032928074?source=cve","https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-mesmerize-and-materialis-themes-fixed-an-authenticated-options-change-vulnerability/","https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=121290%40materialis&new=121290%40materialis&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=121291%40mesmerize&new=121291%40mesmerize&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://wordpress.org/themes/materialis/","https://wordpress.org/themes/mesmerize/","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/e4d70f03-69d5-4cca-8300-985f68d19ddc","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8c9c3302-47cd-4dbe-b79e-5e6032928074?source=cve"]}
