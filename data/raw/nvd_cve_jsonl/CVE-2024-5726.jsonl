{"id":"CVE-2024-5726","publishedDate":"2024-07-18T02:15:02.613","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Timeline Event History plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.1 via deserialization of untrusted input 'timelines-data' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/timeline-event-history/trunk/includes/admin/timeline-wp-build.php#L5","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/timeline-event-history/trunk/includes/public/templates/style-another/index.php#L5","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/timeline-event-history/trunk/includes/public/templates/style-one/index.php#L7","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/107afaa6-6c0b-43fb-9713-ebc4f1189ea6?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/timeline-event-history/trunk/includes/admin/timeline-wp-build.php#L5","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/timeline-event-history/trunk/includes/public/templates/style-another/index.php#L5","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/timeline-event-history/trunk/includes/public/templates/style-one/index.php#L7","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/107afaa6-6c0b-43fb-9713-ebc4f1189ea6?source=cve"]}
