For example, if the From header contains an (invalid) value \"Spoofed Name  \", Thunderbird treats spoofed@example.com as the actual address. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 128.10.1 and Thunderbird < 138.0.1.","references":["https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1950629","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2025-34/","https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2025-35/"]}
