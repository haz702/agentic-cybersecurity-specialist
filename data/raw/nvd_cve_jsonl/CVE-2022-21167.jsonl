The socket client in the package can pass in the payload via the user-controllable input after it has been established, because this socket client transmission does not have the appropriate restrictions or type bindings for the BinaryFormatter.","references":["https://github.com/ldqk/Masuit.Tools/blob/327f42b9f20f25bb66188672199c8265fc968d91/Masuit.Tools.Abstractions/Net/SocketClient.cs%23L197","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DOTNET-MASUITTOOLSCORE-2316875","https://github.com/ldqk/Masuit.Tools/blob/327f42b9f20f25bb66188672199c8265fc968d91/Masuit.Tools.Abstractions/Net/SocketClient.cs%23L197","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DOTNET-MASUITTOOLSCORE-2316875"]}
