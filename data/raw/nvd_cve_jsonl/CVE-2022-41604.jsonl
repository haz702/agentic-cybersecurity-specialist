{"id":"CVE-2022-41604","publishedDate":"2022-09-27T23:15:17.263","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Check Point ZoneAlarm Extreme Security before 15.8.211.19229 allows local users to escalate privileges. This occurs because of weak permissions for the %PROGRAMDATA%\\CheckPoint\\ZoneAlarm\\Data\\Updates directory, and a self-protection driver bypass that allows creation of a junction directory. This can be leveraged to perform an arbitrary file move as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.","references":["https://github.com/Wh04m1001/ZoneAlarmEoP","https://www.infigo.hr/en/insights/39/elevation-of-privilege-in-zonealarm-extreme-security/","https://www.zonealarm.com/software/extreme-security/release-history","https://github.com/Wh04m1001/ZoneAlarmEoP","https://www.infigo.hr/en/insights/39/elevation-of-privilege-in-zonealarm-extreme-security/","https://www.zonealarm.com/software/extreme-security/release-history"]}
