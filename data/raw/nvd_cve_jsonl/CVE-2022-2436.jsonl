{"id":"CVE-2022-2436","publishedDate":"2022-09-06T18:15:13.710","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'file[package_dir]' parameter in versions up to, and including 3.2.49. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor privileges and above to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/download-manager/trunk/src/Admin/Menu/Packages.php#L68","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2761422%40download-manager%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2FAdmin%2FMenu%2FPackages.php&new=2761422%40download-manager%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2FAdmin%2FMenu%2FPackages.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/471957f6-54c1-4268-b2e1-8efa391dcaec?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2436","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/download-manager/trunk/src/Admin/Menu/Packages.php#L68","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2761422%40download-manager%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2FAdmin%2FMenu%2FPackages.php&new=2761422%40download-manager%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2FAdmin%2FMenu%2FPackages.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/471957f6-54c1-4268-b2e1-8efa391dcaec?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2436"]}
