Ensure the\nwork item is canceled so we do not have use-after-free\ncrash in case cleanup is called before the work item\nis executed.\n\nThis fixes crash on my x86_64 apu2 when mt7921k radio\nfails to work.  Radio still fails, but OS does not\ncrash.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/38fbe806645090c07aa97171f20fc62c3d7d3a98","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/827e7799c61b978fbc2cc9dac66cb62401b2b3f0","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ac1260b661c2ef0d0a56680cdb5672b931b7be8f","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c1a5e6002ec441a3b9fb4d048b4b49ae93409a46"]}
