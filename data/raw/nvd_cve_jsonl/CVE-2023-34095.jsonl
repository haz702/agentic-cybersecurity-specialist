{"id":"CVE-2023-34095","publishedDate":"2023-06-14T17:15:09.243","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"cpdb-libs provides frontend and backend libraries for the Common Printing Dialog Backends (CPDB) project. In versions 1.0 through 2.0b4, cpdb-libs is vulnerable to buffer overflows via improper use of `scanf(3)`. cpdb-libs uses the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions to parse command lines and configuration files, dropping the read string components into fixed-length buffers, but does not limit the length of the strings to be read by `fscanf()` and `scanf()` causing buffer overflows when a string is longer than 1023 characters. A patch for this issue is available at commit f181bd1f14757c2ae0f17cc76dc20421a40f30b7. As all buffers have a length of 1024 characters, the patch limits the maximum string length to be read to 1023 by replacing all occurrences of `%s` with `%1023s` in all calls of the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/06/14/7","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/blob/85555fba64d34f53a2fce099b0488904cc48ed35/cpdb/cpdb-frontend.c#L372","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/blob/85555fba64d34f53a2fce099b0488904cc48ed35/tools/cpdb-text-frontend.c#L362","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/blob/85555fba64d34f53a2fce099b0488904cc48ed35/tools/cpdb-text-frontend.c#L453","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/commit/f181bd1f14757c2ae0f17cc76dc20421a40f30b7","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/security/advisories/GHSA-25j7-9gfc-f46x","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/06/14/7","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/blob/85555fba64d34f53a2fce099b0488904cc48ed35/cpdb/cpdb-frontend.c#L372","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/blob/85555fba64d34f53a2fce099b0488904cc48ed35/tools/cpdb-text-frontend.c#L362","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/blob/85555fba64d34f53a2fce099b0488904cc48ed35/tools/cpdb-text-frontend.c#L453","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/commit/f181bd1f14757c2ae0f17cc76dc20421a40f30b7","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs/security/advisories/GHSA-25j7-9gfc-f46x"]}
