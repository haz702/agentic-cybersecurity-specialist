{"id":"CVE-2023-34966","publishedDate":"2023-07-20T15:15:11.333","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An infinite loop vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets sent by the client, the core unmarshalling function sl_unpack_loop() did not validate a field in the network packet that contains the count of elements in an array-like structure. By passing 0 as the count value, the attacked function will run in an endless loop consuming 100% CPU. This flaw allows an attacker to issue a malformed RPC request, triggering an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service condition.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6667","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7139","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0423","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0580","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4101","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-34966","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2222793","https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2023-34966","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6667","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7139","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0423","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0580","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4101","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-34966","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2222793","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BPCSGND7LO467AJGR5DYBGZLTCGTOBCC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OT74M42E6C36W7PQVY3OS4ZM7DVYB64Z/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230731-0010/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5477","https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2023-34966"]}
