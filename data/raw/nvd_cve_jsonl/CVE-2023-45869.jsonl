{"id":"CVE-2023-45869","publishedDate":"2023-10-26T15:15:09.010","cvssV3":9.0,"description":"ILIAS 7.25 (2023-09-12) allows any authenticated user to execute arbitrary operating system commands remotely, when a highly privileged account accesses an XSS payload. The injected commands are executed via the exec() function in the execQuoted() method of the ilUtil class (/Services/Utilities/classes/class.ilUtil.php) This allows attackers to inject malicious commands into the system, potentially compromising the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the ILIAS installation and the underlying operating system.","references":["https://rehmeinfosec.de/labor/cve-2023-45869","https://rehmeinfosec.de/report/358ad5f6-f712-4f74-a5ee-476efc856cbc/","https://rehmeinfosec.de/labor/cve-2023-45869","https://rehmeinfosec.de/report/358ad5f6-f712-4f74-a5ee-476efc856cbc/"]}
