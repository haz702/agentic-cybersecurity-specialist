{"id":"CVE-2023-30843","publishedDate":"2023-04-26T21:15:09.177","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"Payload is a free and open source headless content management system. In versions prior to 1.7.0, if a user has access to documents that contain hidden fields or fields they do not have access to, the user could reverse-engineer those values via brute force. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, write a `beforeOperation` hook to remove `where` queries that attempt to access hidden field data.","references":["https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/releases/tag/v1.7.0","https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/security/advisories/GHSA-35jj-vqcf-f2jf","https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/releases/tag/v1.7.0","https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/security/advisories/GHSA-35jj-vqcf-f2jf"]}
