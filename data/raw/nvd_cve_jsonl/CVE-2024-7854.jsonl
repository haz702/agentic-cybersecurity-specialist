This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-inquiry/trunk/includes/functions.php?rev=2088873#L307","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/312a6601-c914-4661-82ff-6f8bac849442?source=cve"]}
