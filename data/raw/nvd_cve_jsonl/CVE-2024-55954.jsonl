{"id":"CVE-2024-55954","publishedDate":"2025-01-16T20:15:32.890","cvssV3":8.7,"description":"OpenObserve is a cloud-native observability platform. A vulnerability in the user management endpoint `/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` allows an \"Admin\" role user to remove a \"Root\" user from the organization. This violates the intended privilege hierarchy, enabling a non-root user to remove the highest-privileged account. Due to insufficient role checks, the `remove_user_from_org` function does not prevent an \"Admin\" user from removing a \"Root\" user. As a result, an attacker with an \"Admin\" role can remove critical \"Root\" users, potentially gaining effective full control by eliminating the highest-privileged accounts. The `DELETE /api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` endpoint is affected. This issue has been addressed in release version `0.14.1` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","references":["https://github.com/gaby/openobserve/blob/main/src/service/users.rs#L631","https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/security/advisories/GHSA-m8gj-6r85-3r6m"]}
