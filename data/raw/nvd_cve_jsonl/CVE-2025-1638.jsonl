{"id":"CVE-2025-1638","publishedDate":"2025-03-01T08:15:34.167","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Alloggio Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity through the alloggio_membership_init_rest_api_facebook_login and alloggio_membership_init_rest_api_google_login functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including administrators, without knowing a password.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/alloggio-hotel-booking-theme/26775539","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/60405e54-e869-4623-892c-0821014f887b?source=cve"]}
