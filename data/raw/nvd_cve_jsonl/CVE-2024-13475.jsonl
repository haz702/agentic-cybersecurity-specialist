This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3237693/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c62680b5-e9e0-497f-b957-9b223a623917?source=cve"]}
