{"id":"CVE-2020-13757","publishedDate":"2020-06-01T19:15:10.067","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Python-RSA before 4.1 ignores leading '\\0' bytes during decryption of ciphertext. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact, e.g., by helping an attacker to infer that an application uses Python-RSA, or if the length of accepted ciphertext affects application behavior (such as by causing excessive memory allocation).","references":["https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/146","https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/146#issuecomment-641845667","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2KILTHBHNSDUCYV22ODLOKTICJJ7JQIQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZYB65VNILRBTXL6EITQTH2PZPK7I23MW/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4478-1/","https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/146","https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/146#issuecomment-641845667","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2KILTHBHNSDUCYV22ODLOKTICJJ7JQIQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZYB65VNILRBTXL6EITQTH2PZPK7I23MW/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4478-1/"]}
