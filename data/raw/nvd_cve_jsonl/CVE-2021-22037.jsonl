{"id":"CVE-2021-22037","publishedDate":"2021-10-29T12:15:07.573","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Under certain circumstances, when manipulating the Windows registry, InstallBuilder uses the reg.exe system command. The full path to the command is not enforced, which results in a search in the search path until a binary can be identified. This makes the installer/uninstaller vulnerable to Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking, potentially allowing an attacker to plant a malicious reg.exe command so it takes precedence over the system command. The vulnerability only affects Windows installers.","references":["https://blog.installbuilder.com/2021/10/installbuilder-2160-released.html","https://blog.installbuilder.com/2021/10/installbuilder-2160-released.html"]}
