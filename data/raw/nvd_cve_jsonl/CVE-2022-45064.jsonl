{"id":"CVE-2022-45064","publishedDate":"2023-04-13T11:15:06.737","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"The SlingRequestDispatcher doesn't correctly implement the RequestDispatcher API resulting in a generic type of include-based cross-site scripting issues on the Apache Sling level. The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker that is able to include a resource with specific content-type and control the include path (i.e. writing content). The impact of a successful attack is privilege escalation to administrative power.\n\n\n\n\nPlease update to Apache Sling Engine >= 2.14.0 and enable the \"Check Content-Type overrides\" configuration option.\n\n\n\n\n","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/18/6","https://lists.apache.org/thread/hhp611hltby3whk03vx2mv7cmy3vs0ok","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/18/6","https://lists.apache.org/thread/hhp611hltby3whk03vx2mv7cmy3vs0ok"]}
