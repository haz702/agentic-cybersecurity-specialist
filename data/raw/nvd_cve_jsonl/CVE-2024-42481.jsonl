{"id":"CVE-2024-42481","publishedDate":"2024-08-12T16:15:15.990","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Skyport Daemon (skyportd) is the daemon for the Skyport Panel. By making thousands of folders & files (easy due to skyport's lack of rate limiting on createFolder. createFile), skyportd in a lot of cases will cause 100% CPU usage and an OOM, probably crashing the system. This is fixed in 0.2.2.","references":["https://github.com/skyportlabs/skyportd/security/advisories/GHSA-cwmq-phcx-9g92"]}
