{"id":"CVE-2025-26597","publishedDate":"2025-02-25T16:15:38.797","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A buffer overflow flaw was found in X.Org and Xwayland. If XkbChangeTypesOfKey() is called with a 0 group, it will resize the key symbols table to 0 but leave the key actions unchanged. If the same function is later called with a non-zero value of groups, this will cause a buffer overflow because the key actions are of the wrong size.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2500","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2502","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2861","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2862","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2865","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2866","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2873","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2874","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2875","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2879","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:2880","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7163","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7165","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7458","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-26597","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2345255"]}
