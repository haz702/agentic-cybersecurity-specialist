{"id":"CVE-2025-24836","publishedDate":"2025-02-13T22:15:12.270","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"With a specially crafted Python script, an attacker could send \ncontinuous startMeasurement commands over an unencrypted Bluetooth \nconnection to the affected device. This would prevent the device from \nconnecting to a clinician's app to take patient readings and ostensibly \nflood it with requests, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-044-01","https://www.qardio.com/about-us/#contact"]}
