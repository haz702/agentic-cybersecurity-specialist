{"id":"CVE-2023-6558","publishedDate":"2024-01-11T09:15:49.037","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The Export and Import Users and Customers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation on the 'upload_import_file' function in versions up to, and including, 2.4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with shop manager-level capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/users-customers-import-export-for-wp-woocommerce/tags/2.4.7/admin/modules/import/classes/class-import-ajax.php#L124","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3008454/users-customers-import-export-for-wp-woocommerce#file197","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/55b3e2dc-dc4f-408b-bbc6-da72ed5ad245?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/users-customers-import-export-for-wp-woocommerce/tags/2.4.7/admin/modules/import/classes/class-import-ajax.php#L124","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3008454/users-customers-import-export-for-wp-woocommerce#file197","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/55b3e2dc-dc4f-408b-bbc6-da72ed5ad245?source=cve"]}
