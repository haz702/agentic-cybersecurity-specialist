{"id":"CVE-2025-27167","publishedDate":"2025-03-11T18:15:34.730","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Illustrator versions 29.2.1, 28.7.4 and earlier are affected by an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability that might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the application uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted application would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the application trusts.","references":["https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/illustrator/apsb25-17.html"]}
