{"id":"CVE-2024-37408","publishedDate":"2024-06-08T14:15:11.307","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"fprintd through 1.94.3 lacks a security attention mechanism, and thus unexpected actions might be authorized by \"auth sufficient pam_fprintd.so\" for Sudo. NOTE: the supplier disputes this because they believe issue resolution would involve modifying the PAM configuration to restrict pam_fprintd.so to front-ends that implement a proper attention mechanism, not modifying pam_fprintd.so or fprintd.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/13/3","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/14/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/14/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/14/3","https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/fprintd/-/releases","https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fprint/2024-May/001231.html","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/30/3","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/13/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/13/3","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/14/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/14/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/14/3","https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/fprintd/-/releases","https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fprint/2024-May/001231.html","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/30/3","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/13/2"]}
