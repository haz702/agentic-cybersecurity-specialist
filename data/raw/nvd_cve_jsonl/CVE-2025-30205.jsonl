{"id":"CVE-2025-30205","publishedDate":"2025-03-24T17:15:21.667","cvssV3":7.6,"description":"kanidim-provision is a helper utility that uses kanidm's API to provision users, groups and oauth2 systems. Prior to version 1.2.0, a faulty function intrumentation in the (optional) kanidm patches provided by kandim-provision will cause the provisioned admin credentials to be leaked to the system log. This only impacts users which both use the provided patches and provision their `admin` or `idm_admin` account credentials this way. No other credentials are affected. Users should recompile kanidm with the newest patchset from tag `v1.2.0` or higher. As a workaround, the user can set the log level `KANIDM_LOG_LEVEL` to any level higher than `info`, for example `warn`.","references":["https://github.com/oddlama/kanidm-provision/commit/a102b52e4a79be4263068577ba837f16c3e487a2","https://github.com/oddlama/kanidm-provision/security/advisories/GHSA-57fc-pcqm-53rp"]}
