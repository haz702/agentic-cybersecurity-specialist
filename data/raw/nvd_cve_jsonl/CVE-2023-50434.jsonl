{"id":"CVE-2023-50434","publishedDate":"2024-04-29T22:15:06.883","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"emdns_resolve_raw in emdns.c in emdns through fbd1eef calls strlen with an input that may not be '\\0' terminated, leading to a stack-based buffer over-read. This can be triggered by a remote adversary that can send DNS requests to the emdns server. The impact could vary depending on the system libraries, compiler, and processor architecture. Code before be565c3 is unaffected.","references":["https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/esorics2024.pdf","https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/esorics2024.pdf"]}
