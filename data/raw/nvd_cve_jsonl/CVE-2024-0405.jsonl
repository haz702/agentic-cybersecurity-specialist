{"id":"CVE-2024-0405","publishedDate":"2024-01-17T05:15:08.913","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The Burst Statistics \u2013 Privacy-Friendly Analytics for WordPress plugin, version 1.5.3, is vulnerable to Post-Authenticated SQL Injection via multiple JSON parameters in the /wp-json/burst/v1/data/compare endpoint. Affected parameters include 'browser', 'device', 'page_id', 'page_url', 'platform', and 'referrer'. This vulnerability arises due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters and the lack of adequate preparation in SQL queries. As a result, authenticated attackers with editor access or higher can append additional SQL queries into existing ones, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information from the database.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/burst-statistics/trunk/statistics/class-statistics.php?rev=3011996#L380","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/burst-statistics/trunk/statistics/class-statistics.php?rev=3011996#L926","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3020809%40burst-statistics%2Ftrunk&old=3012004%40burst-statistics%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e349f07d-a520-4700-a6e0-25e68c1deeae?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/burst-statistics/trunk/statistics/class-statistics.php?rev=3011996#L380","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/burst-statistics/trunk/statistics/class-statistics.php?rev=3011996#L926","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3020809%40burst-statistics%2Ftrunk&old=3012004%40burst-statistics%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e349f07d-a520-4700-a6e0-25e68c1deeae?source=cve"]}
