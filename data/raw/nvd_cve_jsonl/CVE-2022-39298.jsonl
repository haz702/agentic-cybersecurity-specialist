It deals with showing pages, plugins, URL rewritting, search optimization and SEO, etc. Attackers can deserialize arbitrary data on affected versions of `melisplatform/melis-front`, and ultimately leads to the execution of arbitrary PHP code on the system. Conducting this attack does not require authentication. Users should immediately upgrade to `melisplatform/melis-front` >= 5.0.1. This issue was addressed by restricting allowed classes when deserializing user-controlled data.","references":["https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-front/commit/89ae612d5f1f7aa2fb621ee8de27dffe1feb851e","https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-front/security/advisories/GHSA-h479-2mv4-5c26","https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-front/commit/89ae612d5f1f7aa2fb621ee8de27dffe1feb851e","https://github.com/melisplatform/melis-front/security/advisories/GHSA-h479-2mv4-5c26"]}
