{"id":"CVE-2023-45896","publishedDate":"2024-08-28T05:15:13.657","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"ntfs3 in the Linux kernel through 6.8.0 allows a physically proximate attacker to read kernel memory by mounting a filesystem (e.g., if a Linux distribution is configured to allow unprivileged mounts of removable media) and then leveraging local access to trigger an out-of-bounds read. A length value can be larger than the amount of memory allocated. NOTE: the supplier's perspective is that there is no vulnerability when an attack requires an attacker-modified filesystem image.","references":["https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.5.11","https://dfir.ru/2024/06/19/vulnerabilities-in-7-zip-and-ntfs3/","https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=013ff63b649475f0ee134e2c8d0c8e65284ede50","https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/013ff63b649475f0ee134e2c8d0c8e65284ede50"]}
