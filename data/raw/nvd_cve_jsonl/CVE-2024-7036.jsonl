This prevents administrators from performing essential user management actions such as deleting, editing, or adding users. The vulnerability can also be exploited by authenticated users with low privileges, leading to the same unresponsive state in the Admin panel.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/ba62d093-ab27-48fa-9c53-0602c8cdc48a"]}
