{"id":"CVE-2020-15592","publishedDate":"2020-07-27T14:15:12.397","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"SteelCentral Aternity Agent before 11.0.0.120 on Windows allows Privilege Escalation via a crafted file. It uses an executable running as a high privileged Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other processes. It distributes functionality among different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to enable the processes to cooperate. The remotely callable methods from remotable objects available through interprocess communication allow loading of arbitrary plugins (i.e., C# assemblies) from the \"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins\u201d directory, where the name of the plugin is passed as part of an XML-serialized object. However, because the name of the DLL is concatenated with the \u201c.\\plugins\u201d string, a directory traversal vulnerability exists in the way plugins are resolved.","references":["https://aternity.force.com/customersuccess/s/article/Recorder-tool-security-notification-mitigation-steps-for-On-Prem","https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-steelcentral-aternity-agent-cve-2020-15592-cve-2020-15593/","https://aternity.force.com/customersuccess/s/article/Recorder-tool-security-notification-mitigation-steps-for-On-Prem","https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-steelcentral-aternity-agent-cve-2020-15592-cve-2020-15593/"]}
