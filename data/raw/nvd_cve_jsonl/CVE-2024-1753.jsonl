{"id":"CVE-2024-1753","publishedDate":"2024-03-18T15:15:41.170","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"A flaw was found in Buildah (and subsequently Podman Build) which allows containers to mount arbitrary locations on the host filesystem into build containers. A malicious Containerfile can use a dummy image with a symbolic link to the root filesystem as a mount source and cause the mount operation to mount the host root filesystem inside the RUN step. The commands inside the RUN step will then have read-write access to the host filesystem, allowing for full container escape at build time.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2049","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2055","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2064","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2066","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2077","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2084","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2089","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2090","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2097","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2098","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2548","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2645","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2669","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2672","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2784","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2877","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3254","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-1753","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265513","https://github.com/containers/buildah/security/advisories/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf","https://github.com/containers/podman/security/advisories/GHSA-874v-pj72-92f3","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2658","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2049","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2055","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2064","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2066","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2077","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2084","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2089","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2090","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2097","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2098","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2548","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2645","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2669","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2672","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2784","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2877","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3254","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-1753","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265513","https://github.com/containers/buildah/security/advisories/GHSA-pmf3-c36m-g5cf","https://github.com/containers/podman/security/advisories/GHSA-874v-pj72-92f3","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FCRZVUDOFM5CPREQKBEU2VK2QK62PSBP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KOYMVMQ7RWMDTSKQTBO734BE3WQPI2AJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZVBSVZGVABPYIHK5HZM472NPGWMI7WXH/"]}
