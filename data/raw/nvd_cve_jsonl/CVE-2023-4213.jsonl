{"id":"CVE-2023-4213","publishedDate":"2023-09-13T03:15:08.877","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Simplr Registration Form Plus+ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 2.4.5. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/simplr-registration-form/trunk/lib/profile.php#L148","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6ddf0452-3afe-4ada-bccc-30c818968a81?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/simplr-registration-form/trunk/lib/profile.php#L148","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6ddf0452-3afe-4ada-bccc-30c818968a81?source=cve"]}
