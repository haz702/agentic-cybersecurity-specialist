{"id":"CVE-2023-6563","publishedDate":"2023-12-14T18:15:45.540","cvssV3":7.7,"description":"An unconstrained memory consumption vulnerability was discovered in Keycloak. It can be triggered in environments which have millions of offline tokens (> 500,000 users with each having at least 2 saved sessions). If an attacker creates two or more user sessions and then open the \"consents\" tab of the admin User Interface, the UI attempts to load a huge number of offline client sessions leading to excessive memory and CPU consumption which could potentially crash the entire system.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7854","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7855","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7856","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7857","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7858","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6563","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2253308","https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/13340","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7854","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7855","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7856","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7857","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7858","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6563","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2253308","https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/13340"]}
