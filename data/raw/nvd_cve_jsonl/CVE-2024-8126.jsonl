This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an Administrator, to upload a new .htaccess file allowing them to subsequently upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/file-manager-advanced/trunk/application/class_fma_connector.php?rev=3004748","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3157713/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/801d6cde-f9c6-4e68-8bfc-ff8c0593372d?source=cve"]}
