{"id":"CVE-2024-10954","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:22.230","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"In the `manim` plugin of binary-husky/gpt_academic, versions prior to the fix, a vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user-provided prompts. The root cause is the execution of untrusted code generated by the LLM without a proper sandbox. This allows an attacker to perform remote code execution (RCE) on the app backend server by injecting malicious code through the prompt.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/72d034e3-6ca2-495d-98a7-ac9565588c09"]}
