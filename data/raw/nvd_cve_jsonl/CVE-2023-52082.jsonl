{"id":"CVE-2023-52082","publishedDate":"2023-12-28T16:16:02.290","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Lychee is a free photo-management tool.  Prior to 5.0.2, Lychee is vulnerable to an SQL injection on any binding when using mysql/mariadb. This injection is only active for users with the `.env` settings set to DB_LOG_SQL=true and DB_LOG_SQL_EXPLAIN=true. The defaults settings of Lychee are safe.  The patch is provided on version 5.0.2.  To work around this issue, disable SQL EXPLAIN logging.\n","references":["https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/commit/33354a2ce7cf700cc4ee537b7b8b94dfc1e84ad4","https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/security/advisories/GHSA-rjwv-5j3m-p5x4","https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/commit/33354a2ce7cf700cc4ee537b7b8b94dfc1e84ad4","https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/security/advisories/GHSA-rjwv-5j3m-p5x4"]}
