{"id":"CVE-2023-1194","publishedDate":"2023-11-03T08:15:07.490","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory read flaw was found in parse_lease_state in the KSMBD implementation of the in-kernel samba server and CIFS in the Linux kernel. When an attacker sends the CREATE command with a malformed payload to KSMBD, due to a missing check of `NameOffset` in the `parse_lease_state()` function, the `create_context` object can access invalid memory.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1194","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2154176","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231221-0006/","https://www.spinics.net/lists/stable-commits/msg303065.html","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1194","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2154176","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231221-0006/","https://www.spinics.net/lists/stable-commits/msg303065.html"]}
