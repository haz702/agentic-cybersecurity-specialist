{"id":"CVE-2024-31459","publishedDate":"2024-05-14T15:25:26.110","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework. Prior to version 1.2.27, there is a file inclusion issue in the `lib/plugin.php` file. Combined with SQL injection vulnerabilities, remote code execution can be implemented. There is a file inclusion issue with the `api_plugin_hook()` function in the `lib/plugin.php` file, which reads the plugin_hooks and plugin_config tables in database. The read data is directly used to concatenate the file path which is used for file inclusion. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.","references":["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-cx8g-hvq8-p2rv","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-gj3f-p326-gh8r","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-pfh9-gwm6-86vp","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RBEOAFKRARQHTDIYSL723XAFJ2Q6624X/","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-cx8g-hvq8-p2rv","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-gj3f-p326-gh8r","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-pfh9-gwm6-86vp","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RBEOAFKRARQHTDIYSL723XAFJ2Q6624X/"]}
