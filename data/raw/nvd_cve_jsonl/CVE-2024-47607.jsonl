{"id":"CVE-2024-47607","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:32.363","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components.  stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the gst_opus_dec_parse_header function within `gstopusdec.c'. The pos array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If n_channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the pos array. The value written will always be GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE. This bug allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8037.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0024.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-115_GHSL-2024-118_Gstreamer/"]}
