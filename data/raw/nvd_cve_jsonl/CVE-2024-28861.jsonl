{"id":"CVE-2024-28861","publishedDate":"2024-03-22T17:15:07.770","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Symfony 1 is a community-driven fork of the 1.x branch of Symfony, a PHP framework for web projects. Starting in version 1.1.0 and prior to version 1.5.19, Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to dangerous deserialization in `sfNamespacedParameterHolder` class that would enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer deserializes user input in their project. Version 1.5.19 contains a patch for the issue.","references":["https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1/commit/0bd9d59c69221f49bfc8be8b871b79e12d7d171a","https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1/security/advisories/GHSA-pv9j-c53q-h433","https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1/commit/0bd9d59c69221f49bfc8be8b871b79e12d7d171a","https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony1/symfony1/security/advisories/GHSA-pv9j-c53q-h433"]}
