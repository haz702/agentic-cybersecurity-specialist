{"id":"CVE-2023-3295","publishedDate":"2023-06-17T02:15:08.917","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Unlimited Elements For Elementor (Free Widgets, Addons, Templates) for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation of files in the file manager functionality in versions up to, and including, 1.5.66 . This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The issue was partially patched in version 1.5.66 and fully patched in 1.5.67. CVE-2023-31231 appears to be a duplicate of this issue.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/inc_php/unitecreator_assets.class.php#L1005","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ce1ac711-6026-49ef-b66b-2cc199697942?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/trunk/inc_php/unitecreator_assets.class.php#L1005","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ce1ac711-6026-49ef-b66b-2cc199697942?source=cve"]}
