{"id":"CVE-2025-46337","publishedDate":"2025-05-01T18:15:57.510","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"ADOdb is a PHP database class library that provides abstractions for performing queries and managing databases. Prior to version 5.22.9, improper escaping of a query parameter may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements when the code using ADOdb connects to a PostgreSQL database and calls pg_insert_id() with user-supplied data. This issue has been patched in version 5.22.9.","references":["https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb/commit/11107d6d6e5160b62e05dff8a3a2678cf0e3a426","https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb/issues/1070","https://github.com/ADOdb/ADOdb/security/advisories/GHSA-8x27-jwjr-8545","https://xaliom.blogspot.com/2025/05/from-sast-to-cve-2025-46337.html"]}
