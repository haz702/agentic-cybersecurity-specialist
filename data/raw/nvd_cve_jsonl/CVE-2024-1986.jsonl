{"id":"CVE-2024-1986","publishedDate":"2024-03-07T21:15:08.013","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Booster Elite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the wc_add_new_product() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.1.7. This makes it possible for customer-level attackers, and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable when the user product upload functionality is enabled.","references":["https://booster.io/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L132","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L138","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L322","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L333","https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-jetpack/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c9c2fb7f-a05b-4852-97eb-7befe880d703?source=cve","https://booster.io/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L132","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L138","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L322","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-jetpack/trunk/includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-add-form-shortcodes.php#L333","https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-jetpack/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c9c2fb7f-a05b-4852-97eb-7befe880d703?source=cve"]}
