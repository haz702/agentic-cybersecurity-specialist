{"id":"CVE-2022-4939","publishedDate":"2023-04-05T19:15:07.453","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"THe WCFM Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including 2.10.0, due to a missing capability check on the wp_ajax_nopriv_wcfm_ajax_controller AJAX action that controls membership settings. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the membership registration form in a way that allows them to set the role for registration to that of any user including administrators. Once configured, the attacker can then register as an administrator.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2633191%40wc-multivendor-membership&new=2633191%40wc-multivendor-membership&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0870de2d-bca5-4d57-a07f-877a416ce0d5?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2633191%40wc-multivendor-membership&new=2633191%40wc-multivendor-membership&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0870de2d-bca5-4d57-a07f-877a416ce0d5?source=cve"]}
