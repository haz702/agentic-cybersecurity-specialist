{"id":"CVE-2024-12389","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:28.247","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in binary-husky/gpt_academic version git 310122f. The application supports the extraction of user-provided 7z files without proper validation. The Python py7zr package used for extraction does not guarantee that files will remain within the intended extraction directory. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform arbitrary file writes, which can lead to remote code execution.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/37afb1c9-bba9-47ee-8617-a5f715271654"]}
