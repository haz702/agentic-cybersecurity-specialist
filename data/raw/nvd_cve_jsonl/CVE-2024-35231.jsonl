{"id":"CVE-2024-35231","publishedDate":"2024-05-27T17:15:09.760","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"rack-contrib provides contributed rack middleware and utilities for Rack, a Ruby web server interface. Versions of rack-contrib prior to 2.5.0 are vulnerable to denial of service due to the fact that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not constrained to any limitation. This would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation and a potential denial of service by remotely user-controlled data. Version 2.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.","references":["https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/commit/0eec2a9836329051c6742549e65a94a4c24fe6f7","https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-8c8q-2xw3-j869","https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/commit/0eec2a9836329051c6742549e65a94a4c24fe6f7","https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-8c8q-2xw3-j869"]}
