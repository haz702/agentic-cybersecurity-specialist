{"id":"CVE-2024-3291","publishedDate":"2024-05-17T17:15:07.740","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"When installing Nessus Agent to a directory outside of the default location on a Windows host, Nessus Agent versions prior to 10.6.4 did not enforce secure permissions for sub-directories. This could allow for local privilege escalation if users had not secured the directories in the non-default installation location.","references":["https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2024-09","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2024-09"]}
