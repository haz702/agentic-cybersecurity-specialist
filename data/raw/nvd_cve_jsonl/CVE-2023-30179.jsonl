{"id":"CVE-2023-30179","publishedDate":"2023-06-13T17:15:14.600","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"CraftCMS version 3.7.59 is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). An authenticated attacker can inject Twig Template to User Photo Location field when setting User Photo Location in User Settings, lead to Remote Code Execution. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because only Administrators can add this Twig code, and (by design) Administrators are allowed to do that by default.","references":["https://datnlq.gitbook.io/cve/craft-cms/cve-2023-30179-server-side-template-injection","https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#442---2023-03-14","https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/2443#issuecomment-1610040714","https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/2443#issuecomment-1610634200","https://datnlq.gitbook.io/cve/craft-cms/cve-2023-30179-server-side-template-injection","https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#442---2023-03-14","https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/2443#issuecomment-1610040714","https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/2443#issuecomment-1610634200"]}
