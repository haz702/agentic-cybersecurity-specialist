This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/golo-directory-listing-travel-wordpress-theme/25397810","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e6cb81e5-61a4-4b67-a668-d8a7d46b2cea?source=cve"]}
