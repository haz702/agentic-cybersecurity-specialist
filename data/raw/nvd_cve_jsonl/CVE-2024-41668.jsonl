{"id":"CVE-2024-41668","publishedDate":"2024-07-23T19:15:13.437","cvssV3":8.3,"description":"The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics provides visualization, analysis, and download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets. When running a publicly exposed proxy endpoint without authentication, cBioPortal could allow someone to perform a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. Logged in users could do the same on private instances. A fix has been released in version 6.0.12. As a workaround, one might be able to disable `/proxy` endpoint entirely via, for example, nginx.","references":["https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/commit/ea8642fdbda2d61d2ab34b9da7a1594680bbbcd5","https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/pull/10884","https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/releases/tag/v6.0.12","https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/security/advisories/GHSA-9h44-r3c3-q7rm","https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/security-research-advisories/vuln/WLX-2024-004","https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/commit/ea8642fdbda2d61d2ab34b9da7a1594680bbbcd5","https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/pull/10884","https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/releases/tag/v6.0.12","https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/security/advisories/GHSA-9h44-r3c3-q7rm","https://www.wizlynxgroup.com/security-research-advisories/vuln/WLX-2024-004"]}
