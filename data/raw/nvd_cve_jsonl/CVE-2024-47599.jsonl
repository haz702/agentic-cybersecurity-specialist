{"id":"CVE-2024-47599","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:31.440","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the gst_jpeg_dec_negotiate function in gstjpegdec.c. This function does not check for a NULL return value from gst_video_decoder_set_output_state. When this happens, dereferences of the outstate pointer will lead to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8040.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0016.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-247_Gstreamer/"]}
