The error handing will call cpuhp_state_remove_instance()\nto call uncore pmu offline callback, which migrate the pmu context.\nSince that's liable to lead to some kind of use-after-free.\n\nUse cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls() instead of\ncpuhp_state_remove_instance() so that the notifiers don't execute after\nthe PMU device has been failed to register.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0e1e88bba286621b886218363de07b319d6208b2","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3405f364f82d4f5407a8b4c519dc15d24b847fda","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75bab28ffd05ec8879c197890b1bd1dfec8d3f63","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b660420f449d094b1fabfa504889810b3a63cdd5","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b805cafc604bfdb671fae7347a57f51154afa735","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0e1e88bba286621b886218363de07b319d6208b2","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3405f364f82d4f5407a8b4c519dc15d24b847fda","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75bab28ffd05ec8879c197890b1bd1dfec8d3f63","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b660420f449d094b1fabfa504889810b3a63cdd5","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b805cafc604bfdb671fae7347a57f51154afa735"]}
