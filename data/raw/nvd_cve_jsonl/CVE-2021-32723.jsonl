{"id":"CVE-2021-32723","publishedDate":"2021-06-28T20:15:07.857","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"Prism is a syntax highlighting library. Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24. As a workaround, do not use ASCIIDoc or ERB to highlight untrusted text. Other languages are not affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text.","references":["https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2688","https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2774","https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2688","https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2774","https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html"]}
