{"id":"CVE-2024-32866","publishedDate":"2024-04-23T21:15:48.407","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"Conform, a type-safe form validation library, allows the parsing of nested objects in the form of `object.property`. Due to an improper implementation of this feature in versions prior to 1.1.1, an attacker can exploit the feature to trigger prototype pollution by passing a crafted input to `parseWith...` functions. Applications that use conform for server-side validation of form data or URL parameters are affected by this vulnerability. Version 1.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.\n","references":["https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/blob/59156d7115a7207fa3b6f8a70a4342a9b24c2501/packages/conform-dom/formdata.ts#L117","https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/commit/4819d51b5a53fd5486fc85c17cdc148eb160e3de","https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/security/advisories/GHSA-624g-8qjg-8qxf","https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/blob/59156d7115a7207fa3b6f8a70a4342a9b24c2501/packages/conform-dom/formdata.ts#L117","https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/commit/4819d51b5a53fd5486fc85c17cdc148eb160e3de","https://github.com/edmundhung/conform/security/advisories/GHSA-624g-8qjg-8qxf"]}
