{"id":"CVE-2022-26357","publishedDate":"2022-04-05T13:15:07.777","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"race in VT-d domain ID cleanup Xen domain IDs are up to 15 bits wide. VT-d hardware may allow for only less than 15 bits to hold a domain ID associating a physical device with a particular domain. Therefore internally Xen domain IDs are mapped to the smaller value range. The cleaning up of the housekeeping structures has a race, allowing for VT-d domain IDs to be leaked and flushes to be bypassed.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/05/2","http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-399.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6ETPM2OVZZ6KOS2L7QO7SIW6XWT5OW3F/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UHFSRVLM2JUCPDC2KGB7ETPQYJLCGBLD/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-07","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5117","https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-399.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/05/2","http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-399.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6ETPM2OVZZ6KOS2L7QO7SIW6XWT5OW3F/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UHFSRVLM2JUCPDC2KGB7ETPQYJLCGBLD/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-07","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5117","https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-399.txt"]}
