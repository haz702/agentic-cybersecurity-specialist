{"id":"CVE-2024-11194","publishedDate":"2024-11-19T12:15:16.497","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Classified Listing \u2013 Classified ads & Business Directory Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a misconfigured check on the 'rtcl_import_settings' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.15.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update limited arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the Subscriber role with Administrator-level capabilities to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. The vulnerability is limited in that the option updated must have a value that is an array.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/classified-listing/tags/3.1.12/app/Controllers/Ajax/Import.php#L309","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/classified-listing/tags/3.1.12/app/Controllers/Ajax/Import.php#L473","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3189516/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/13d9a59f-1a1a-4936-a5ab-8a5e0c50303b?source=cve"]}
