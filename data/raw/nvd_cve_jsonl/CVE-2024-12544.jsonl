{"id":"CVE-2024-12544","publishedDate":"2025-03-01T08:15:33.367","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The SurveyJS: Drag & Drop WordPress Form Builder to create, style and embed multiple forms of any complexity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to a missing capability check on the callback function of the SurveyJS_DeleteFile class in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.17. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This function is still vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery as of 1.12.20.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3214665/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3222216/surveyjs/trunk/ajax_handlers/delete_file.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e9404fe4-855e-4eb4-81c4-5246f6e9be0c?source=cve"]}
