{"id":"CVE-2024-21632","publishedDate":"2024-01-02T22:15:10.103","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"omniauth-microsoft_graph provides an Omniauth strategy for the Microsoft Graph API. Prior to versions 2.0.0, the implementation did not validate the legitimacy of the `email` attribute of the user nor did it give/document an option to do so, making it susceptible to nOAuth misconfiguration in cases when the `email` is used as a trusted user identifier. This could lead to account takeover. Version 2.0.0 contains a fix for this issue.\n","references":["https://github.com/synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph/commit/f132078389612b797c872b45bd0e0b47382414c1","https://github.com/synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph/security/advisories/GHSA-5g66-628f-7cvj","https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth","https://github.com/synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph/commit/f132078389612b797c872b45bd0e0b47382414c1","https://github.com/synth/omniauth-microsoft_graph/security/advisories/GHSA-5g66-628f-7cvj","https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth"]}
