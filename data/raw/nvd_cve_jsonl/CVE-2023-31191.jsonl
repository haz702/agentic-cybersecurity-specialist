{"id":"CVE-2023-31191","publishedDate":"2023-07-11T09:15:09.653","cvssV3":9.3,"description":"DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver from BlueMark Innovations is affected by an information loss vulnerability through traffic injection.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting, on carefully selected channels, high power spoofed Open Drone ID (ODID) messages which force the DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver to drop real Remote ID (RID) information and, instead, generate and transmit JSON encoded MQTT messages containing crafted RID information. Consequently, the MQTT broker, typically operated by a system integrator, will have no access to the drones\u2019 real RID information.\n\nThis issue affects the adjacent channel suppression algorithm present in DroneScout ds230 firmware from version 20211210-1627 through 20230329-1042.","references":["https://download.bluemark.io/dronescout/firmware/history.txt","https://www.nozominetworks.com/labs/vulnerability-advisories-cve-2023-31191/","https://download.bluemark.io/dronescout/firmware/history.txt","https://www.nozominetworks.com/labs/vulnerability-advisories-cve-2023-31191/"]}
