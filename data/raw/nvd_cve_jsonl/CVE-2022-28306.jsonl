{"id":"CVE-2022-28306","publishedDate":"2023-03-29T19:15:09.513","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Bentley MicroStation CONNECT 10.16.02.034. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of OBJ files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-16174.","references":["https://www.bentley.com/en/common-vulnerability-exposure/be-2022-0008","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-595/","https://www.bentley.com/en/common-vulnerability-exposure/be-2022-0008","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-595/"]}
