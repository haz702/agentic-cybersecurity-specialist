{"id":"CVE-2022-33745","publishedDate":"2022-07-26T13:15:10.003","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"insufficient TLB flush for x86 PV guests in shadow mode For migration as well as to work around kernels unaware of L1TF (see XSA-273), PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode. To address XSA-401, code was moved inside a function in Xen. This code movement missed a variable changing meaning / value between old and new code positions. The now wrong use of the variable did lead to a wrong TLB flush condition, omitting flushes where such are necessary.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/26/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/26/3","http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-408.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HUFIMNGYP5VQAA6KE3T2I5GW6UP6F7BS/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MYI3OMJ7RIZNL3C6GUWNANNPEUUID6FM/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5272","https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-408.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/26/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/26/3","http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-408.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HUFIMNGYP5VQAA6KE3T2I5GW6UP6F7BS/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MYI3OMJ7RIZNL3C6GUWNANNPEUUID6FM/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5272","https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-408.txt"]}
