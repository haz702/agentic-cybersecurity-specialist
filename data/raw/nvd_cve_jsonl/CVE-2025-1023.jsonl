The newCountName\u00a0parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate database queries and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.","references":["https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/issues/7246"]}
