{"id":"CVE-2022-1941","publishedDate":"2022-09-22T15:15:09.203","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A parsing vulnerability for the MessageSet type in the ProtocolBuffers versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 3.21.5 for protobuf-cpp, and versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 4.21.5 for protobuf-python can lead to out of memory failures. A specially crafted message with multiple key-value per elements creates parsing issues, and can lead to a Denial of Service against services receiving unsanitized input. We recommend upgrading to versions 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 3.21.6 for protobuf-cpp and 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 4.21.6 for protobuf-python. Versions for 3.16 and 3.17 are no longer updated.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/09/27/1","https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#GCP-2022-019","https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00019.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CBAUKJQL6O4TIWYBENORSY5P43TVB4M3/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MPCGUT3T5L6C3IDWUPSUO22QDCGQKTOP/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240705-0001/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/09/27/1","https://cloud.google.com/support/bulletins#GCP-2022-019","https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00019.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CBAUKJQL6O4TIWYBENORSY5P43TVB4M3/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MPCGUT3T5L6C3IDWUPSUO22QDCGQKTOP/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240705-0001/"]}
