{"id":"CVE-2024-32004","publishedDate":"2024-05-14T19:15:11.377","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, an attacker can prepare a local repository in such a way that, when cloned, will execute arbitrary code during the operation. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. As a workaround, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2","https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone","https://github.com/git/git/commit/f4aa8c8bb11dae6e769cd930565173808cbb69c8","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-xfc6-vwr8-r389","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00018.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S4CK4IYTXEOBZTEM5K3T6LWOIZ3S44AR/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2","https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone","https://github.com/git/git/commit/f4aa8c8bb11dae6e769cd930565173808cbb69c8","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-xfc6-vwr8-r389","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00018.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S4CK4IYTXEOBZTEM5K3T6LWOIZ3S44AR/"]}
