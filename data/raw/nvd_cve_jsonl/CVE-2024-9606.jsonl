{"id":"CVE-2024-9606","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:49.443","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In berriai/litellm before version 1.44.12, the `litellm/litellm_core_utils/litellm_logging.py` file contains a vulnerability where the API key masking code only masks the first 5 characters of the key. This results in the leakage of almost the entire API key in the logs, exposing a significant amount of the secret key. The issue affects version v1.44.9.","references":["https://github.com/berriai/litellm/commit/9094071c4782183e84f10630e2450be3db55509a","https://huntr.com/bounties/4a03796f-a8d4-4293-84ef-d3959456223a"]}
