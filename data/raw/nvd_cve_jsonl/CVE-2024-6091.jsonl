{"id":"CVE-2024-6091","publishedDate":"2024-09-11T13:15:03.440","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A vulnerability in significant-gravitas/autogpt version 0.5.1 allows an attacker to bypass the shell commands denylist settings. The issue arises when the denylist is configured to block specific commands, such as 'whoami' and '/bin/whoami'. An attacker can circumvent this restriction by executing commands with a modified path, such as '/bin/./whoami', which is not recognized by the denylist.","references":["https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/commit/ef691359b774a1f9f80cf4f5ace9821967b718ed","https://huntr.com/bounties/8a742c13-bb5e-4bc9-8b86-049d8a386050"]}
