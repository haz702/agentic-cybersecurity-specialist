{"id":"CVE-2024-2928","publishedDate":"2024-06-06T19:15:55.680","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in mlflow/mlflow, specifically in version 2.9.2, which was fixed in version 2.11.3. This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../'. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system, including sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. The vulnerability is a bypass to a previous patch that only addressed similar manipulation within the URI's query string, highlighting the need for comprehensive validation of all parts of a URI to prevent LFI attacks.","references":["https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/96f0b573a73d8eedd6735a2ce26e08859527be07","https://huntr.com/bounties/19bf02d7-6393-4a95-b9d0-d6d4d2d8c298","https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/96f0b573a73d8eedd6735a2ce26e08859527be07","https://huntr.com/bounties/19bf02d7-6393-4a95-b9d0-d6d4d2d8c298"]}
