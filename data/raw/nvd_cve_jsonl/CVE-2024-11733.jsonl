This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wordpress-popular-posts/tags/7.1.0/src/Rest/ViewLoggerEndpoint.php#L70","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c38ac8d6-c6de-4be7-bf7b-198e085a0ad2?source=cve"]}
