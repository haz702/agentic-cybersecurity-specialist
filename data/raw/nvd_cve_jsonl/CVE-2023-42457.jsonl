{"id":"CVE-2023-42457","publishedDate":"2023-09-21T15:15:10.943","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"plone.rest allows users to use HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. in Plone. Starting in the 2.x branch and prior to versions 2.0.1 and 3.0.1, when the `++api++` traverser is accidentally used multiple times in a url, handling it takes increasingly longer, making the server less responsive. Patches are available in `plone.rest` 2.0.1 and 3.0.1.  Series 1.x is not affected. As a workaround, one may redirect `/++api++/++api++` to `/++api++` in one's frontend web server (nginx, Apache).","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/2","https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/commit/43b4a7e86206e237e1de5ca3817ed071575882f7","https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/commit/77846a9842889b24f35e8bedc2e9d461388d3302","https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/security/advisories/GHSA-h6rp-mprm-xgcq","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/2","https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/commit/43b4a7e86206e237e1de5ca3817ed071575882f7","https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/commit/77846a9842889b24f35e8bedc2e9d461388d3302","https://github.com/plone/plone.rest/security/advisories/GHSA-h6rp-mprm-xgcq"]}
