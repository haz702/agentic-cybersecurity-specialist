{"id":"CVE-2024-43110","publishedDate":"2024-09-05T05:15:13.757","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The ctl_request_sense function could expose up to three bytes of the kernel heap to userspace.\n\nMalicious software running in a guest VM that exposes virtio_scsi can exploit the vulnerabilities to achieve code execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process, which typically runs as root.  Note that bhyve runs in a Capsicum sandbox, so malicious code is constrained by the capabilities available to the bhyve process.  A malicious iSCSI initiator could achieve remote code execution on the iSCSI target host.","references":["https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-24:11.ctl.asc"]}
