When a set of policy rules references these usernames, D-Bus may free some memory in the heap, which is still used by data structures necessary for the other usernames sharing the UID, possibly leading to a crash or other undefined behaviors","references":["https://bugs.gentoo.org/755392","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1909101","https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/-/issues/305#note_829128","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-35512","https://bugs.gentoo.org/755392","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1909101","https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/-/issues/305#note_829128","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-35512"]}
