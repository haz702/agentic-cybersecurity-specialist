{"id":"CVE-2023-4571","publishedDate":"2023-08-30T17:15:11.080","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"In Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) versions below below 4.13.3, 4.15.3, or 4.17.1, a malicious actor can inject American National Standards Institute (ANSI) escape codes into Splunk ITSI log files that, when a vulnerable terminal application reads them, can run malicious code in the vulnerable application. This attack requires a user to use a terminal application that translates ANSI escape codes to read the malicious log file locally in the vulnerable terminal. The vulnerability also requires additional user interaction to succeed. \n\nThe vulnerability does not directly affect Splunk ITSI. The indirect impact on Splunk ITSI can vary significantly depending on the permissions in the vulnerable terminal application, as well as where and how the user reads the malicious log file. For example, users can copy the malicious file from Splunk ITSI and read it on their local machine.","references":["https://advisory.splunk.com/advisories/SVD-2023-0810","https://advisory.splunk.com/advisories/SVD-2023-0810"]}
