{"id":"CVE-2023-26436","publishedDate":"2023-06-20T08:15:09.607","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"Attackers with access to the \"documentconverterws\" API were able to inject serialized Java objects, that were not properly checked during deserialization. Access to this API endpoint is restricted to local networks by default. Arbitrary code could be injected that is being executed when processing the request. A check has been introduced to restrict processing of legal and expected classes for this API. We now log a warning in case there are attempts to inject illegal classes. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173083/OX-App-Suite-SSRF-Resource-Consumption-Command-Injection.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jun/8","https://documentation.open-xchange.com/appsuite/security/advisories/csaf/2023/oxas-adv-2023-0002.json","https://software.open-xchange.com/products/appsuite/doc/Release_Notes_for_Patch_Release_6219_7.10.6_2023-03-20.pdf","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173083/OX-App-Suite-SSRF-Resource-Consumption-Command-Injection.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jun/8","https://documentation.open-xchange.com/appsuite/security/advisories/csaf/2023/oxas-adv-2023-0002.json","https://software.open-xchange.com/products/appsuite/doc/Release_Notes_for_Patch_Release_6219_7.10.6_2023-03-20.pdf"]}
