{"id":"CVE-2022-24125","publishedDate":"2022-03-20T01:15:08.667","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The matchmaking servers of Bandai Namco FromSoftware Dark Souls III through 2022-03-19 allow remote attackers to send arbitrary push requests to clients via a RequestSendMessageToPlayers request. For example, ability to send a push message to hundreds of thousands of machines is only restricted on the client side, and can thus be bypassed with a modified client.","references":["https://fromsoftware.jp","https://github.com/tremwil/ds3-nrssr-rce","https://fromsoftware.jp","https://github.com/tremwil/ds3-nrssr-rce"]}
