{"id":"CVE-2024-7423","publishedDate":"2024-09-13T15:15:16.527","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Stream plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the network_options_action() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options that can lead to DoS or privilege escalation via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/stream/tags/4.0.1/classes/class-network.php#L353","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3139815/stream/trunk/classes/class-network.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9d15e418-36bb-4f53-ac67-8f6122591dd2?source=cve"]}
