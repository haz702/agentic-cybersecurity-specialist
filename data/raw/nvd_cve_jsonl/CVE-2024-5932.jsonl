{"id":"CVE-2024-5932","publishedDate":"2024-08-20T02:15:04.240","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"The GiveWP \u2013 Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.14.1 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'give_title' parameter.
