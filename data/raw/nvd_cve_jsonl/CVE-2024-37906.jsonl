{"id":"CVE-2024-37906","publishedDate":"2024-07-29T15:15:10.747","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"Admidio is a free, open source user management system for websites of organizations and groups. In Admidio before version 4.3.9, there is an SQL Injection in the `/adm_program/modules/ecards/ecard_send.php` source file of the Admidio Application. The SQL Injection results in a compromise of the application's database. The value of `ecard_recipients `POST parameter is being directly concatenated with the SQL query in the source code causing the SQL Injection. The SQL Injection can be exploited by a member user, using blind condition-based, time-based, and Out of band interaction SQL Injection payloads. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.3.9.","references":["https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/commit/3ff02b0c64a6911ab3e81cd61077f392c0b25248","https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-69wx-xc6j-28v3","https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/commit/3ff02b0c64a6911ab3e81cd61077f392c0b25248","https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-69wx-xc6j-28v3"]}
