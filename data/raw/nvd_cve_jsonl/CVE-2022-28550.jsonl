{"id":"CVE-2022-28550","publishedDate":"2023-06-13T20:15:08.907","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Matthias-Wandel/jhead jhead 3.06 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow via shellescape(), jhead.c, jhead. jhead copies strings to a stack buffer when it detects a &i or &o. However, jhead does not check the boundary of the stack buffer. As a result, there will be a stack buffer overflow problem when multiple `&i` or `&o` are given.","references":["https://github.com/Matthias-Wandel/jhead/commit/64894dbc7d8e1e232e85f1cab25c64290b2fc167","https://github.com/Matthias-Wandel/jhead/issues/51","https://github.com/Matthias-Wandel/jhead/commit/64894dbc7d8e1e232e85f1cab25c64290b2fc167","https://github.com/Matthias-Wandel/jhead/issues/51"]}
