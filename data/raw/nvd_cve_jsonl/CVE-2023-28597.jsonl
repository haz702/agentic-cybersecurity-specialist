{"id":"CVE-2023-28597","publishedDate":"2023-03-27T21:15:12.260","cvssV3":8.3,"description":"Zoom clients prior to 5.13.5 contain an improper trust boundary implementation vulnerability. If a victim saves a local recording to an SMB location and later opens it using a link from Zoom\u2019s web portal, an attacker positioned on an adjacent network to the victim client could set up a malicious SMB server to respond to client requests, causing the client to execute attacker controlled executables. This could result in an attacker gaining access to a user's device and data, and remote code execution.","references":["https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/security/security-bulletin/","https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/security/security-bulletin/"]}
