{"id":"CVE-2024-10979","publishedDate":"2024-11-14T13:15:04.407","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Incorrect control of environment variables in PostgreSQL PL/Perl allows an unprivileged database user to change sensitive process environment variables (e.g. PATH).  That often suffices to enable arbitrary code execution, even if the attacker lacks a database server operating system user.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21 are affected.","references":["https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-10979/","https://github.com/fmora50591/postgresql-env-vuln/blob/main/README.md","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250110-0003/"]}
