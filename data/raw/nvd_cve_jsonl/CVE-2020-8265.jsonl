{"id":"CVE-2020-8265","publishedDate":"2021-01-06T21:15:14.410","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other exploits.","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/988103","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/H472D5HPXN6RRXCNFML3BK5OYC52CXF2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K4I6MZNC7C7VIDQR267OL4TVCI3ZKAC4/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/january-2021-security-releases/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-07","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210212-0003/","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4826","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://hackerone.com/reports/988103","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/H472D5HPXN6RRXCNFML3BK5OYC52CXF2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K4I6MZNC7C7VIDQR267OL4TVCI3ZKAC4/","https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/january-2021-security-releases/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-07","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210212-0003/","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4826","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html"]}
