{"id":"CVE-2023-6196","publishedDate":"2023-11-20T15:15:09.910","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Audio Merchant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the function audio_merchant_add_audio_file function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/audio-merchant/trunk/audio-merchant.php#L1298","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/06513dfe-f263-48b7-ba01-2c205247095b?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/audio-merchant/trunk/audio-merchant.php#L1298","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/06513dfe-f263-48b7-ba01-2c205247095b?source=cve"]}
