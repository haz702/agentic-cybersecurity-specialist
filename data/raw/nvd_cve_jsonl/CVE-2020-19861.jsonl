{"id":"CVE-2020-19861","publishedDate":"2022-01-21T15:15:07.607","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"When a zone file in ldns 1.7.1 is parsed, the function ldns_nsec3_salt_data is too trusted for the length value obtained from the zone file. When the memcpy is copied, the 0xfe - ldns_rdf_size(salt_rdf) byte data can be copied, causing heap overflow information leakage.","references":["https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/126.html","https://github.com/NLnetLabs/ldns/issues/51","https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/126.html","https://github.com/NLnetLabs/ldns/issues/51"]}
