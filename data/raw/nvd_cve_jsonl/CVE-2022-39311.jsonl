{"id":"CVE-2022-39311","publishedDate":"2022-10-14T20:15:16.183","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 are vulnerable to remote code execution on the server from a malicious or compromised agent. The Spring RemoteInvocation endpoint exposed agent communication and allowed deserialization of arbitrary java objects, as well as subsequent remote code execution. Exploitation requires agent-level authentication, thus an attacker would need to either compromise an existing agent, its network communication or register a new agent to practically exploit this vulnerability. This issue is fixed in GoCD version 21.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.","references":["https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/7b88b70d6f7f429562d5cab49a80ea856e34cdc8","https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-2hjh-3p3p-8hcm","https://www.gocd.org/releases/#21-1-0","https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/7b88b70d6f7f429562d5cab49a80ea856e34cdc8","https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-2hjh-3p3p-8hcm","https://www.gocd.org/releases/#21-1-0"]}
