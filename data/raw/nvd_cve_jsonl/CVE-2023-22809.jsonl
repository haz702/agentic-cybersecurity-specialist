{"id":"CVE-2023-22809","publishedDate":"2023-01-18T17:15:10.353","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a \"--\" argument that defeats a protection mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file' value.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171644/sudo-1.9.12p1-Privilege-Escalation.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172509/Sudoedit-Extra-Arguments-Privilege-Escalation.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174234/Cisco-ThousandEyes-Enterprise-Agent-Virtual-Appliance-Arbitrary-File-Modification.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Aug/21","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/01/19/1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00012.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2QDGFCGAV5QRJCE6IXRXIS4XJHS57DDH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G4YNBTTKTRT2ME3NTSXAPTOKYUE47XHZ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-12","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230127-0015/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213758","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5321","https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/sudoedit_any/","https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/2023-01/sudo-CVE-2023-22809.pdf","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171644/sudo-1.9.12p1-Privilege-Escalation.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172509/Sudoedit-Extra-Arguments-Privilege-Escalation.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/174234/Cisco-ThousandEyes-Enterprise-Agent-Virtual-Appliance-Arbitrary-File-Modification.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Aug/21","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/01/19/1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00012.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2QDGFCGAV5QRJCE6IXRXIS4XJHS57DDH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G4YNBTTKTRT2ME3NTSXAPTOKYUE47XHZ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-12","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230127-0015/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213758","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5321","https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/sudoedit_any/","https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/2023-01/sudo-CVE-2023-22809.pdf"]}
