{"id":"CVE-2024-39903","publishedDate":"2024-07-12T15:15:11.177","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"Solara is a pure Python, React-style framework for scaling Jupyter and web apps. A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was identified in widgetti/solara, in version <1.35.1, which was fixed in version 1.35.1. This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../' when serving static files. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system.","references":["https://github.com/widgetti/solara/commit/df2fd66a7f4e8ffd36e8678697a8a4f76760dc54","https://github.com/widgetti/solara/security/advisories/GHSA-9794-pc4r-438w","https://github.com/widgetti/solara/commit/df2fd66a7f4e8ffd36e8678697a8a4f76760dc54","https://github.com/widgetti/solara/security/advisories/GHSA-9794-pc4r-438w"]}
