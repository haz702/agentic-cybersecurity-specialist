{"id":"CVE-2020-25560","publishedDate":"2021-08-11T21:15:07.990","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to use the hardcoded credential in clients (username: sapphire, password: ims) and gain access to the portal. Once the access is available, the attacker can inject malicious OS commands on \u201cping\u201d, \u201ctraceroute\u201d and \u201csnmp\u201d functions and execute code on the server. We also observed the same is true if the JSESSIONID is completely removed.","references":["https://vuln.shellcoder.party/2020/09/19/cve-2020-25560-sapphireims-unauthenticated-remote-command-execution-on-server/","https://vuln.shellcoder.party/tags/sapphireims/","https://vuln.shellcoder.party/2020/09/19/cve-2020-25560-sapphireims-unauthenticated-remote-command-execution-on-server/","https://vuln.shellcoder.party/tags/sapphireims/"]}
