{"id":"CVE-2023-29487","publishedDate":"2023-12-21T01:15:32.897","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"An issue was discovered in Heimdal Thor agent versions 3.4.2 and before on Windows and 2.6.9 and before on macOS, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) via the Threat To Process Correlation threat prevention module. NOTE: Heimdal asserts this is not a valid vulnerability. Their DNS Security for Endpoint solution includes an optional feature to provide extra information on the originating process that made a DNS request. The lack of process identification in DNS logs is therefore falsely categorized as a DoS issue.","references":["https://medium.com/%40drabek.a/weaknesses-in-heimdal-thors-line-of-products-9d0e5095fb93","https://medium.com/%40drabek.a/weaknesses-in-heimdal-thors-line-of-products-9d0e5095fb93"]}
