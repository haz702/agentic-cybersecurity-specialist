{"id":"CVE-2022-31087","publishedDate":"2022-06-27T21:15:08.337","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users, groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. In versions prior to 8.0 the tmp directory, which is accessible by /lam/tmp/, allows interpretation of .php (and .php5/.php4/.phpt/etc) files. An attacker capable of writing files under www-data privileges can write a web-shell into this directory, and gain a Code Execution on the host. This issue has been fixed in version 8.0. Users unable to upgrade should disallow executing PHP scripts in (/var/lib/ldap-account-manager/)tmp directory.","references":["https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/f1d5d04952f39a1b4ea203d3964fa88e1429dfd4","https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-q8g5-45m4-q95p","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5177","https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/f1d5d04952f39a1b4ea203d3964fa88e1429dfd4","https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-q8g5-45m4-q95p","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5177"]}
