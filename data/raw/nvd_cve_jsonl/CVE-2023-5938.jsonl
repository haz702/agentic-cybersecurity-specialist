{"id":"CVE-2023-5938","publishedDate":"2024-05-15T17:15:09.733","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"Multiple functions use archives without properly validating the filenames therein, rendering the application vulnerable to path traversal via 'zip slip' attacks.\n\n\n\nAn administrator able to provide tampered archives to be processed by the affected versions of Arc may be able to have arbitrary files extracted to arbitrary filesystem locations. Leveraging this issue, an attacker may be able to overwrite arbitrary files on the target filesystem and cause critical impacts on the system (e.g., arbitrary command execution on the victim\u2019s machine).","references":["https://security.nozominetworks.com/NN-2023:16-01","https://security.nozominetworks.com/NN-2023:16-01"]}
