{"id":"CVE-2023-3825","publishedDate":"2023-07-31T23:15:10.437","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"\nPTC\u2019s KEPServerEX Versions 6.0 to 6.14.263 are vulnerable to being made to read a recursively defined object that leads to uncontrolled resource consumption. KEPServerEX uses OPC UA, a protocol which defines various object types that can be nested to create complex arrays. It does not implement a check to see if such an object is recursively defined, so an attack could send a maliciously created message that the decoder would try to decode until the stack overflowed and the device crashed.\n\n","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-208-02","https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-208-02"]}
