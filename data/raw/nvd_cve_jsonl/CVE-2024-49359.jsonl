{"id":"CVE-2024-49359","publishedDate":"2024-10-24T22:15:04.287","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"ZimaOS is a fork of CasaOS, an operating system for Zima devices and x86-64 systems with UEFI. In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v2_1/file` in ZimaOS is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing authenticated users to list the contents of any directory on the server. By manipulating the path parameter, attackers can access sensitive system directories such as `/etc`, potentially exposing critical configuration files and increasing the risk of further attacks. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.","references":["https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-mwpw-fhrm-728x","https://youtu.be/IuaEH09ot9s"]}
