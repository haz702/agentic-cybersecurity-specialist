{"id":"CVE-2023-42464","publishedDate":"2023-09-20T15:15:11.817","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in the Spotlight RPC functions in afpd in Netatalk 3.1.x before 3.1.17. When parsing Spotlight RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in the underlying protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the dalloc_value_for_key() function, which returns the object associated with a key, a malicious actor may be able to fully control the value of the pointer and theoretically achieve Remote Code Execution on the host. This issue is similar to CVE-2023-34967.","references":["https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/issues/486","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00031.html","https://netatalk.io/security/CVE-2023-42464","https://netatalk.sourceforge.io/","https://netatalk.sourceforge.io/3.1/htmldocs/afpd.8.html","https://netatalk.sourceforge.io/CVE-2023-42464.php","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5503","https://github.com/Netatalk/netatalk/issues/486","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00031.html","https://netatalk.io/security/CVE-2023-42464","https://netatalk.sourceforge.io/","https://netatalk.sourceforge.io/3.1/htmldocs/afpd.8.html","https://netatalk.sourceforge.io/CVE-2023-42464.php","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5503"]}
