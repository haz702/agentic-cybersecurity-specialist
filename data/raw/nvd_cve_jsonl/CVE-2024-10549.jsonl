{"id":"CVE-2024-10549","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:17.263","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A vulnerability in the `/3/Parse` endpoint of h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0.1 allows for a denial of service (DoS) attack. The endpoint uses a user-specified string to construct a regular expression, which is then applied to another user-specified string. By sending multiple simultaneous requests, an attacker can exhaust all available threads, leading to a complete denial of service.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/ce7bd2d6-fd38-440d-a91a-dd8f3fc06bc2"]}
