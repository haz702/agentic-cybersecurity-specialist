{"id":"CVE-2022-44796","publishedDate":"2022-11-07T04:15:09.600","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712. The authorization service has a flow that allows getting access to the Web UI without knowing credentials. For signing, the JWT token uses a secret key that is generated through a function that doesn't produce cryptographically strong sequences. An attacker can predict these sequences and generate a JWT token. As a result, an attacker can get access to the Web UI. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.","references":["https://objectfirst.com/security/of-20221024-0002/","https://objectfirst.com/security/of-20221024-0002/"]}
