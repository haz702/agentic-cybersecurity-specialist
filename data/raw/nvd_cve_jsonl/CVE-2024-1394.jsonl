{"id":"CVE-2024-1394","publishedDate":"2024-03-21T13:00:08.037","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A memory leak flaw was found in Golang in the RSA encrypting/decrypting code, which might lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability using attacker-controlled inputs\u200b. The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey\u200b and ctx\u200b. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey\u200b and ctx\u200b if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the \"return nil, nil, fail(...)\" pattern, meaning that pkey\u200b and ctx\u200b will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1462","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1468","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1472","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1501","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1502","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1561","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1563","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1566","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1567","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1574","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1640","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1644","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1646","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1763","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1897","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2562","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2568","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2569","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2729","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2730","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2767","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3265","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3352","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4146","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4371","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4378","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4379","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4502","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4581","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4591","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4672","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4699","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4761","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4762","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4960","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5258","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:5634","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:7262","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7118","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-1394","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2262921","https://github.com/golang-fips/openssl/commit/85d31d0d257ce842c8a1e63c4d230ae850348136","https://github.com/golang-fips/openssl/security/advisories/GHSA-78hx-gp6g-7mj6","https://github.com/microsoft/go-crypto-openssl/commit/104fe7f6912788d2ad44602f77a0a0a62f1f259f","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2660","https://vuln.go.dev/ID/GO-2024-2660.json","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1462","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1468","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1472","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1501","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1502","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1561","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1563","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1566","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1567","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1574","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1640","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1644","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1646","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1763","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1897","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2562","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2568","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2569","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2729","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2730","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2767","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3265","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3352","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4146","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4371","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4378","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4379","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4502","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4581","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4591","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4672","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4699","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4761","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4762","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-1394","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2262921","https://github.com/golang-fips/openssl/commit/85d31d0d257ce842c8a1e63c4d230ae850348136","https://github.com/golang-fips/openssl/security/advisories/GHSA-78hx-gp6g-7mj6","https://github.com/microsoft/go-crypto-openssl/commit/104fe7f6912788d2ad44602f77a0a0a62f1f259f","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2660","https://vuln.go.dev/ID/GO-2024-2660.json"]}
