{"id":"CVE-2024-12035","publishedDate":"2025-03-07T09:15:14.387","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The CS Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the cs_widget_file_delete() function in all versions up to, and including, 6.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/jobcareer-job-board-responsive-wordpress-theme/14221636","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/31093664-c45e-4e87-b72f-5cdf8e8e9f67?source=cve"]}
