{"id":"CVE-2022-39173","publishedDate":"2022-09-29T01:15:11.373","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In wolfSSL before 5.5.1, malicious clients can cause a buffer overflow during a TLS 1.3 handshake. This occurs when an attacker supposedly resumes a previous TLS session. During the resumption Client Hello a Hello Retry Request must be triggered. Both Client Hellos are required to contain a list of duplicate cipher suites to trigger the buffer overflow. In total, two Client Hellos have to be sent: one in the resumed session, and a second one as a response to a Hello Retry Request message.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/169600/wolfSSL-Buffer-Overflow.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/24","https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/","https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases","https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/169600/wolfSSL-Buffer-Overflow.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/24","https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/","https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases","https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/"]}
