{"id":"CVE-2024-52807","publishedDate":"2025-01-24T19:15:12.640","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"The HL7 FHIR IG publisher is a tool to take a set of inputs and create a standard FHIR IG. Prior to version 1.7.4, XSLT transforms performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag `( ]>` could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.publisher is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. A previous release provided an incomplete solution revealed by new testing. This issue has been patched as of version 1.7.4. No known workarounds are available.","references":["https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/compare/1.7.3...1.7.4","https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/security/advisories/GHSA-8c3x-hq82-gjcm"]}
