{"id":"CVE-2024-21574","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T09:15:06.037","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"The issue stems from a missing validation of the pip field in a POST request sent to the /customnode/install endpoint used to install custom nodes which is added to the server by the extension. This allows an attacker to craft a request that triggers a pip install on a user controlled package or URL, resulting in remote code execution (RCE) on the server.","references":["https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager/blob/ffc095a3e5acc1c404773a0510e6d055a6a72b0e/glob/manager_server.py#L798","https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager/commit/ffc095a3e5acc1c404773a0510e6d055a6a72b0e"]}
