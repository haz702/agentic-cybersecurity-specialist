{"id":"CVE-2024-56311","publishedDate":"2024-12-22T21:15:16.600","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"REDCap through 14.9.6 has a security flaw in the Notes section of calendar events, exposing users to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. An attacker can exploit this by luring users into accessing a calendar event's notes, which triggers a logout request and terminates their session. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality, allowing malicious actions to be executed without user consent.","references":["https://github.com/ping-oui-no/Vulnerability-Research-CVESS/tree/main/RedCap","https://www.evms.edu/research/resources_services/redcap/redcap_change_log/"]}
