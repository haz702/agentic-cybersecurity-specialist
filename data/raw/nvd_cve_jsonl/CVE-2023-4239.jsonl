{"id":"CVE-2023-4239","publishedDate":"2023-08-09T03:15:45.230","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Real Estate Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 6.7.1 due to insufficient restriction on the 'rem_save_profile_front' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'wp_capabilities' parameter during a profile update.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/real-estate-manager/tags/6.7.1/classes/shortcodes.class.php#L1439","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d83d1fd0-6e21-406e-a7c0-89d26eabbb32?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/real-estate-manager/tags/6.7.1/classes/shortcodes.class.php#L1439","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d83d1fd0-6e21-406e-a7c0-89d26eabbb32?source=cve"]}
