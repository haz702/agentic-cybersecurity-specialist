{"id":"CVE-2024-35186","publishedDate":"2024-05-23T09:15:09.620","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"gitoxide is a pure Rust implementation of Git. During checkout, `gix-worktree-state` does not verify that paths point to locations in the working tree. A specially crafted repository can, when cloned, place new files anywhere writable by the application. This vulnerability leads to a major loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but creating files outside a working tree without attempting to execute code can directly impact integrity as well. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 0.36.0.","references":["https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c","https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide/security/advisories/GHSA-7w47-3wg8-547c"]}
