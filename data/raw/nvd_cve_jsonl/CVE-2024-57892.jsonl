{"id":"CVE-2024-57892","publishedDate":"2025-01-15T13:15:13.710","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocfs2: fix slab-use-after-free due to dangling pointer dqi_priv\n\nWhen mounting ocfs2 and then remounting it as read-only, a\nslab-use-after-free occurs after the user uses a syscall to\nquota_getnextquota.  Specifically, sb_dqinfo(sb, type)->dqi_priv is the\ndangling pointer.\n\nDuring the remounting process, the pointer dqi_priv is freed but is never\nset as null leaving it to be accessed.  Additionally, the read-only option\nfor remounting sets the DQUOT_SUSPENDED flag instead of setting the\nDQUOT_USAGE_ENABLED flags.  Moreover, later in the process of getting the\nnext quota, the function ocfs2_get_next_id is called and only checks the\nquota usage flags and not the quota suspended flags.\n\nTo fix this, I set dqi_priv to null when it is freed after remounting with\nread-only and put a check for DQUOT_SUSPENDED in ocfs2_get_next_id.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: coding-style cleanups]","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2d431192486367eee03cc28d0b53b97dafcb8e63","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2e3d203b1adede46bbba049e497765d67865be18","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/58f9e20e2a7602e1dd649a1ec4790077c251cb6c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f3fd772d152229d94602bca243fbb658068a597","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ff6f635a08c30559ded0c110c7ce03ba7747d11","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba950a02d8d23811aa1120affd3adedcfac6153d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f44e6d70c100614c211703f065cad448050e4a0e"]}
