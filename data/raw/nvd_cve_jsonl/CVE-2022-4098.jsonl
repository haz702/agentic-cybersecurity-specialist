{"id":"CVE-2022-4098","publishedDate":"2022-12-13T08:15:10.283","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"Multiple Wiesemann&Theis products of the ComServer Series are prone to an authentication bypass through IP spoofing. After a user logged in to the WBM of the Com-Server an unauthenticated attacker in the same subnet can obtain the session ID and through IP spoofing change arbitrary settings by crafting modified HTTP Get requests. This may result in a complete takeover of the device.","references":["https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/VDE-2022-057/","https://cert.vde.com/en/advisories/VDE-2022-057/"]}
