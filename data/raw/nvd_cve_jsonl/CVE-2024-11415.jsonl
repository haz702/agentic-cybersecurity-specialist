{"id":"CVE-2024-11415","publishedDate":"2024-11-23T04:15:08.760","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The WP-Orphanage Extended plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wporphanageex_menu_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to escalate the privileges of all orphan accounts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-orphanage-extended/trunk/wp-orphanage-extended-options.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3194570%40wp-orphanage-extended&new=3194570%40wp-orphanage-extended&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f7ed6255-d8df-4f57-961b-1a0c21e352ac?source=cve"]}
