{"id":"CVE-2024-47775","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:40.430","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been found in the parse_ds64 function within gstwavparse.c. The parse_ds64 function does not check that the buffer buf contains sufficient data before attempting to read from it, doing multiple GST_READ_UINT32_LE operations without performing boundary checks. This can lead to an OOB-read when buf is smaller than expected. This vulnerability allows reading beyond the bounds of the data buffer, potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or the leak of sensitive data. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8042.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0027.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-261_Gstreamer/"]}
