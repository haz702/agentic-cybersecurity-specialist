{"id":"CVE-2024-45368","publishedDate":"2024-09-13T17:15:12.800","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The H2-DM1E PLC's authentication protocol appears to utilize either a custom encoding scheme or a challenge-response protocol. However, there's an observed anomaly in the H2-DM1E PLC's protocol execution, namely its acceptance of multiple distinct packets as valid authentication responses. This behavior deviates from standard security practices where a single, specific response or encoding pattern is expected for successful authentication.","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-256-17"]}
