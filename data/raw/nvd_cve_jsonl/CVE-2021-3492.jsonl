{"id":"CVE-2021-3492","publishedDate":"2021-04-17T05:15:13.113","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Shiftfs, an out-of-tree stacking file system included in Ubuntu Linux kernels, did not properly handle faults occurring during copy_from_user() correctly. These could lead to either a double-free situation or memory not being freed at all. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion) or gain privileges via executing arbitrary code.
