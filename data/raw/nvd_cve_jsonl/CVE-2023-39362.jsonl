{"id":"CVE-2023-39362","publishedDate":"2023-09-05T22:15:08.817","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. In Cacti 1.2.24, under certain conditions, an authenticated privileged user, can use a malicious string in the SNMP options of a Device, performing command injection and obtaining remote code execution on the underlying server. The `lib/snmp.php` file has a set of functions, with similar behavior, that accept in input some variables and place them into an `exec` call without a proper escape or validation. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175029/Cacti-1.2.24-Command-Injection.html","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-g6ff-58cj-x3cp","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00018.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5550","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175029/Cacti-1.2.24-Command-Injection.html","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-g6ff-58cj-x3cp","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00018.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5550","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/command-injection-in-cacti-cve-2023-39362"]}
