{"id":"CVE-2023-49291","publishedDate":"2023-12-05T00:15:09.403","cvssV3":9.3,"description":"tj-actions/branch-names is a Github action to retrieve branch or tag names with support for all events. The `tj-actions/branch-names` GitHub Actions improperly references the `github.event.pull_request.head.ref` and `github.head_ref` context variables within a GitHub Actions `run` step. The head ref variable is the branch name and can be used to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted branch name. As a result an attacker can use this vulnerability to steal secrets from or abuse `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 7.0.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","references":["https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/4923d1ca41f928c24f1c1b3af9daaadfb71e6337","https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/6c999acf206f5561e19f46301bb310e9e70d8815","https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/726fe9ba5e9da4fcc716223b7994ffd0358af060","https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/security/advisories/GHSA-8v8w-v8xg-79rf","https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input","https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/4923d1ca41f928c24f1c1b3af9daaadfb71e6337","https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/6c999acf206f5561e19f46301bb310e9e70d8815","https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/726fe9ba5e9da4fcc716223b7994ffd0358af060","https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/security/advisories/GHSA-8v8w-v8xg-79rf","https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input"]}
