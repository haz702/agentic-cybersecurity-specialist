{"id":"CVE-2023-32324","publishedDate":"2023-06-01T17:15:09.873","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system. In versions 2.4.2 and prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack. A buffer overflow vulnerability in the function `format_log_line` could allow remote attackers to cause a DoS on the affected system. Exploitation of the vulnerability can be triggered when the configuration file `cupsd.conf` sets the value of `loglevel `to `DEBUG`. No known patches or workarounds exist at time of publication.","references":["https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/security/advisories/GHSA-cxc6-w2g7-69p7","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00001.html","https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/security/advisories/GHSA-cxc6-w2g7-69p7","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00001.html"]}
