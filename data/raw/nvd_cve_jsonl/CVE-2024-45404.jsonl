{"id":"CVE-2024-45404","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:02:09.530","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"OpenCTI is an open-source cyber threat intelligence platform. In versions below 6.2.18, because the function to limit the rate of OTP does not exist, an attacker with valid credentials or a malicious user who commits internal fraud can break through the two-factor authentication and hijack the account. This is because the otpLogin mutation does not implement One Time Password rate limiting. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether a patch is available.","references":["https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/security/advisories/GHSA-hg56-r6hh-56j7","https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/security/advisories/GHSA-hg56-r6hh-56j7"]}
