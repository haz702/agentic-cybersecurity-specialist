{"id":"CVE-2022-21656","publishedDate":"2022-02-22T23:15:11.223","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. The default_validator.cc implementation used to implement the default certificate validation routines has a \"type confusion\" bug when processing subjectAltNames. This processing allows, for example, an rfc822Name or uniformResourceIndicator to be authenticated as a domain name. This confusion allows for the bypassing of nameConstraints, as processed by the underlying OpenSSL/BoringSSL implementation, exposing the possibility of impersonation of arbitrary servers. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted.","references":["https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/bb95af848c939cfe5b5ee33c5b1770558077e64e","https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-c9g7-xwcv-pjx2","https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/bb95af848c939cfe5b5ee33c5b1770558077e64e","https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-c9g7-xwcv-pjx2"]}
