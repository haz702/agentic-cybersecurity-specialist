{"id":"CVE-2023-31096","publishedDate":"2023-10-10T19:15:09.530","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in Broadcom) LSI PCI-SV92EX Soft Modem Kernel Driver through 2.2.100.1 (aka AGRSM64.sys). There is Local Privilege Escalation to SYSTEM via a Stack Overflow in RTLCopyMemory (IOCTL 0x1b2150). An attacker can exploit this to elevate privileges from a medium-integrity process to SYSTEM. This can also be used to bypass kernel-level protections such as AV or PPL, because exploit code runs with high-integrity privileges and can be used in coordinated BYOVD (bring your own vulnerable driver) ransomware campaigns.","references":["https://cschwarz1.github.io/posts/0x04/","https://www.broadcom.com","https://cschwarz1.github.io/posts/0x04/","https://www.broadcom.com"]}
