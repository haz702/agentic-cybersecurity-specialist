{"id":"CVE-2024-23831","publishedDate":"2024-02-02T16:15:55.593","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"LedgerSMB is a free web-based double-entry accounting system. When a LedgerSMB database administrator has an active session in /setup.pl, an attacker can trick the admin into clicking on a link which automatically submits a request to setup.pl without the admin's consent.  This request can be used to create a new user account with full application (/login.pl) privileges, leading to privilege escalation.  The vulnerability is patched in versions 1.10.30 and 1.11.9.\n","references":["https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/commit/8c2ae5be68a782d62cb9c0e17c0127bf30ef4165","https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/security/advisories/GHSA-98ff-f638-qxjm","https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/commit/8c2ae5be68a782d62cb9c0e17c0127bf30ef4165","https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/security/advisories/GHSA-98ff-f638-qxjm"]}
