{"id":"CVE-2024-4888","publishedDate":"2024-06-06T19:16:03.397","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"BerriAI's litellm, in its latest version, is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to improper input validation on the `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request that includes a file path to the server, which then deletes the specified file without proper authorization or validation. This vulnerability is present in the code where `os.remove(file.filename)` is used to delete a file, allowing any user to delete critical files on the server such as SSH keys, SQLite databases, or configuration files.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/48461d89-cf13-4ad3-a43e-0d37da08fc6c","https://huntr.com/bounties/48461d89-cf13-4ad3-a43e-0d37da08fc6c"]}
