{"id":"CVE-2022-2435","publishedDate":"2022-07-18T17:15:09.187","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The AnyMind Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.1. This is due to missing nonce protection on the createDOMStructure() function found in the ~/anymind-widget-id.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the page, granted they can trick a site\u2019s administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/anymind-widget/trunk/anymind-widget-id.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/174eae70-15d7-4772-8fcd-dc4c0fca5b7d?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2435","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/anymind-widget/trunk/anymind-widget-id.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/174eae70-15d7-4772-8fcd-dc4c0fca5b7d?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2435"]}
