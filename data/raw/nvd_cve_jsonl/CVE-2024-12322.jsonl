{"id":"CVE-2024-12322","publishedDate":"2025-01-07T05:15:18.063","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The ThePerfectWedding.nl Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'update_option' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the 'tpwKey' option with stored cross-site scripting via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/theperfectweddingnl-widget/trunk/admin/tpwAdminPanelTemplate.php#L28","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/theperfectweddingnl-widget/trunk/admin/tpwAdminPanelTemplate.php#L4","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/theperfectweddingnl-widget/trunk/admin/tpwAdminPanelTemplate.php#L48","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/theperfectweddingnl-widget/trunk/admin/tpwAdminPanelTemplate.php#L5","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e996f71a-f0b9-4e10-873e-a0299a099dce?source=cve"]}
