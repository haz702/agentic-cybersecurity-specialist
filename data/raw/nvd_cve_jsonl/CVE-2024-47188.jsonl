{"id":"CVE-2024-47188","publishedDate":"2024-10-16T19:15:27.670","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, missing initialization of the random seed for \"thash\" leads to byte-range tracking having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to an attacker forcing lots of data into a single hash bucket, leading to severe performance degradation. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7.","references":["https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-qq5v-qcjx-f872","https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7289"]}
