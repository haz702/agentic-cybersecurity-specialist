{"id":"CVE-2023-32700","publishedDate":"2023-05-20T18:15:09.370","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"LuaTeX before 1.17.0 allows execution of arbitrary shell commands when compiling a TeX file obtained from an untrusted source. This occurs because luatex-core.lua lets the original io.popen be accessed. This also affects TeX Live before 2023 r66984 and MiKTeX before 23.5.","references":["https://github.com/TeX-Live/texlive-source/releases/tag/build-svn66984","https://gitlab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/texlive/luatex/-/tags/1.17.0","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RLY43MIRONJSJVNBDFQHQ26MP3JIOB3H/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TF6YXUUFRGBIXIIIEV5SGBJXXT2SMUK5/","https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2023-May/049188.html","https://tug.org/~mseven/luatex.html","https://github.com/TeX-Live/texlive-source/releases/tag/build-svn66984","https://gitlab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/texlive/luatex/-/tags/1.17.0","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RLY43MIRONJSJVNBDFQHQ26MP3JIOB3H/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TF6YXUUFRGBIXIIIEV5SGBJXXT2SMUK5/","https://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2023-May/049188.html","https://tug.org/~mseven/luatex.html"]}
