{"id":"CVE-2022-31028","publishedDate":"2022-06-07T16:15:07.760","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"MinIO is a multi-cloud object storage solution. Starting with version RELEASE.2019-09-25T18-25-51Z and ending with version RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z, MinIO is vulnerable to an unending go-routine buildup while keeping connections established due to HTTP clients not closing the connections. Public-facing MinIO deployments are most affected. Users should upgrade to RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z to receive a patch. One possible workaround is to use a reverse proxy to limit the number of connections being attempted in front of MinIO, and actively rejecting connections from such malicious clients.","references":["https://gist.github.com/harshavardhana/2d00e6f909054d2d2524c71485ad02e1","https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/14995","https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2022-06-03T01-40-53Z","https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-qrpr-r3pw-f636","https://gist.github.com/harshavardhana/2d00e6f909054d2d2524c71485ad02e1","https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/14995","https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2022-06-03T01-40-53Z","https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-qrpr-r3pw-f636"]}
