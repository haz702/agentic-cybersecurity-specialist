{"id":"CVE-2022-24764","publishedDate":"2022-03-22T17:15:07.870","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C. Versions 2.12 and prior contain a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that affects PJSUA2 users or users that call the API `pjmedia_sdp_print(), pjmedia_sdp_media_print()`. Applications that do not use PJSUA2 and do not directly call `pjmedia_sdp_print()` or `pjmedia_sdp_media_print()` should not be affected. A patch is available on the `master` branch of the `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. There are currently no known workarounds.","references":["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/560a1346f87aabe126509bb24930106dea292b00","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-f5qg-pqcg-765m","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/560a1346f87aabe126509bb24930106dea292b00","https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-f5qg-pqcg-765m","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285"]}
