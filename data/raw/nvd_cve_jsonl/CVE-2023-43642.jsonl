{"id":"CVE-2023-43642","publishedDate":"2023-09-25T20:15:11.723","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"snappy-java is a Java port of the snappy, a fast C++ compresser/decompresser developed by Google. The SnappyInputStream was found to be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks when decompressing data with a too large chunk size. Due to missing upper bound check on chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur. All versions of snappy-java including the latest released version 1.1.10.3 are vulnerable to this issue. A fix has been introduced in commit `9f8c3cf74` which will be included in the 1.1.10.4 release. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only accept compressed data from trusted sources.","references":["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/9f8c3cf74223ed0a8a834134be9c917b9f10ceb5","https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-55g7-9cwv-5qfv","https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/9f8c3cf74223ed0a8a834134be9c917b9f10ceb5","https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-55g7-9cwv-5qfv"]}
