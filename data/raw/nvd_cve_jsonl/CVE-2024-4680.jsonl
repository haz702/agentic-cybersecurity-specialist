{"id":"CVE-2024-4680","publishedDate":"2024-06-08T20:15:52.347","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A vulnerability in zenml-io/zenml version 0.56.3 allows attackers to reuse old session credentials or session IDs due to insufficient session expiration. Specifically, the session does not expire after a password change, enabling an attacker to maintain access to a compromised account without the victim's ability to revoke this access. This issue was observed in a self-hosted ZenML deployment via Docker, where after changing the password from one browser, the session remained active and usable in another browser without requiring re-authentication.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/c88f6bd2-490d-4930-98dd-03651b20230a","https://huntr.com/bounties/c88f6bd2-490d-4930-98dd-03651b20230a"]}
