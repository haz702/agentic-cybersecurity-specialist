This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the displaySettingsPage() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options that can be leveraged for privilege escalation via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hq-rental-software/tags/1.5.29/includes/settings/HQRentalsAdminSettings.php#L74","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hq-rental-software/tags/1.5.29/includes/settings/HQRentalsSettings.php#L489","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2e9142b2-2935-4644-8c56-00789948202b?source=cve"]}
