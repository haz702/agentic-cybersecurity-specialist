A potential heap buffer overflow exists in the code that parses the HTTP POST request, due to lack of size validation. This vulnerability requires the attacker to send a crafted HTTP POST request with a URI longer than 50 bytes. This leads to a heap overflow in wbs_post() via an strcpy() call.","references":["https://www.forescout.com/blog/new-critical-operational-technology-vulnerabilities-found-on-nichestack/","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/608209","https://www.forescout.com/blog/new-critical-operational-technology-vulnerabilities-found-on-nichestack/","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/608209"]}
