{"id":"CVE-2021-3578","publishedDate":"2022-02-16T19:15:08.507","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A flaw was found in mbsync before v1.3.6 and v1.4.2, where an unchecked pointer cast allows a malicious or compromised server to write an arbitrary integer value past the end of a heap-allocated structure by issuing an unexpected APPENDUID response. This could be plausibly exploited for remote code execution on the client.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/06/07/1","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1961710","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1967397","https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/07/msg00001.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RPIDLIJKNRJHUVBCL7QGAPAAVPIHQGXK/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U75UFEWRAZYKVL5NHMPBUOLWN3WXTOEI/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-15","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/06/07/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/06/07/1","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1961710","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1967397","https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/07/msg00001.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RPIDLIJKNRJHUVBCL7QGAPAAVPIHQGXK/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U75UFEWRAZYKVL5NHMPBUOLWN3WXTOEI/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-15","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/06/07/1"]}
