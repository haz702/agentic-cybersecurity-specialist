{"id":"CVE-2021-29454","publishedDate":"2022-01-10T20:15:08.000","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42 and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user provided data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or 4.0.2 to receive a patch.","references":["https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/commit/215d81a9fa3cd63d82fb3ab56ecaf97cf1e7db71","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/releases/tag/v3.1.42","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/releases/tag/v4.0.2","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/security/advisories/GHSA-29gp-2c3m-3j6m","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00005.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BRAJVDRGCIY5UZ2PQHKDTT7RMKG6WJQQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L777JIBIWJV34HS7LXPIDWASG7TT4LNI/","https://packagist.org/packages/smarty/smarty","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-09","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5151","https://www.smarty.net/docs/en/language.function.math.tpl","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/commit/215d81a9fa3cd63d82fb3ab56ecaf97cf1e7db71","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/releases/tag/v3.1.42","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/releases/tag/v4.0.2","https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty/security/advisories/GHSA-29gp-2c3m-3j6m","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00005.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BRAJVDRGCIY5UZ2PQHKDTT7RMKG6WJQQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L777JIBIWJV34HS7LXPIDWASG7TT4LNI/","https://packagist.org/packages/smarty/smarty","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-09","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5151","https://www.smarty.net/docs/en/language.function.math.tpl"]}
