{"id":"CVE-2021-27379","publishedDate":"2021-02-18T17:15:15.867","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to achieve unintended read/write DMA access, and possibly cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or gain privileges. This occurs because a backport missed a flush, and thus IOMMU updates were not always correct. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-15565.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/02/23/1","http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-366.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4888","https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-366.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/02/23/1","http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-366.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4888","https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-366.html"]}
