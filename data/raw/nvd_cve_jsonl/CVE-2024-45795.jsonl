{"id":"CVE-2024-45795","publishedDate":"2024-10-16T19:15:26.660","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, rules using datasets with the non-functional / unimplemented \"unset\" option can trigger an assertion during traffic parsing, leading to denial of service. This issue is addressed in 7.0.7. As a workaround, use only trusted and well tested rulesets.","references":["https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-6r8w-fpw6-cp9g","https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7195"]}
