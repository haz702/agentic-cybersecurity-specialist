{"id":"CVE-2024-47878","publishedDate":"2024-10-24T21:15:12.293","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"OpenRefine is a free, open source tool for working with messy data. Prior to version 3.8.3, the `/extension/gdata/authorized` endpoint includes the `state` GET parameter verbatim in a `<script>` tag in the output, so without escaping. An attacker could lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL containing JavaScript code, which would then cause that code to be executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine. Version 3.8.3 fixes this issue.","references":["https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/10bf0874d67f1018a58b3732332d76b840192fea","https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-pw3x-c5vp-mfc3"]}
