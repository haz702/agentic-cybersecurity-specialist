{"id":"CVE-2023-26155","publishedDate":"2023-10-14T05:15:55.183","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"All versions of the package node-qpdf are vulnerable to Command Injection such that the package-exported method encrypt() fails to sanitize its parameter input, which later flows into a sensitive command execution API. As a result, attackers may inject malicious commands once they can specify the input pdf file path.","references":["https://github.com/nrhirani/node-qpdf/issues/23","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NODEQPDF-5747918","https://github.com/nrhirani/node-qpdf/issues/23","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NODEQPDF-5747918"]}
