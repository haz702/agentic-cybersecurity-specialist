{"id":"CVE-2023-39852","publishedDate":"2023-08-15T21:15:09.907","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Doctormms v1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the $userid parameter at myAppoinment.php. NOTE: this is disputed by a third party who claims that the userid is a session variable controlled by the server, and thus cannot be used for exploitation. The original reporter counterclaims that this originates from $_SESSION[\"userid\"]=$_POST[\"userid\"] at line 68 in doctors\\doctorlogin.php, where userid under POST is not a session variable controlled by the server.","references":["https://github.com/KLSEHB/vulnerability-report/blob/main/Doctormms_CVE-2023-39852","https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14182/doctor-appointment-system.html","https://github.com/KLSEHB/vulnerability-report/blob/main/Doctormms_CVE-2023-39852","https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14182/doctor-appointment-system.html"]}
