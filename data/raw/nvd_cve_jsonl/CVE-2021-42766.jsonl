{"id":"CVE-2021-42766","publishedDate":"2021-10-20T20:15:07.517","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Ethereum consensus protocol through 2021-10-19 allows an adversary to cause a denial of service (long-range consensus chain reorganizations), even when this adversary has little stake and cannot influence network message propagation. This can cause a protocol stall, or an increase in the profits of individual validators.","references":["https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10086","https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10086"]}
