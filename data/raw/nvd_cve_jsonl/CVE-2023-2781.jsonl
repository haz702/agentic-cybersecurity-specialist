{"id":"CVE-2023-2781","publishedDate":"2023-06-03T00:15:09.353","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The User Email Verification for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass via authenticate_user_by_email in versions up to, and including, 3.5.0. This is due to a random token generation weakness in the resend_verification_email function. This allows unauthenticated attackers to impersonate users and trigger an email address verification for arbitrary accounts, including administrative accounts, and automatically be logged in as that user, including any site administrators. This requires the Allow Automatic Login After Successful Verification setting to be enabled, which it is not by default.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-confirmation-email/tags/3.5.0/public/class-xlwuev-woocommerce-confirmation-email-public.php#L143","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-confirmation-email/tags/3.5.0/public/class-xlwuev-woocommerce-confirmation-email-public.php#L332","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-confirmation-email/tags/3.5.0/public/class-xlwuev-woocommerce-confirmation-email-public.php#L506","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f1e31357-7fbc-414b-a4f4-53fa5f2fc715?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-confirmation-email/tags/3.5.0/public/class-xlwuev-woocommerce-confirmation-email-public.php#L143","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-confirmation-email/tags/3.5.0/public/class-xlwuev-woocommerce-confirmation-email-public.php#L332","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-confirmation-email/tags/3.5.0/public/class-xlwuev-woocommerce-confirmation-email-public.php#L506","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f1e31357-7fbc-414b-a4f4-53fa5f2fc715?source=cve"]}
