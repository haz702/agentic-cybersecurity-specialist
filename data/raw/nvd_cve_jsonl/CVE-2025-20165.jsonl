{"id":"CVE-2025-20165","publishedDate":"2025-01-22T17:15:13.010","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A vulnerability in the SIP processing subsystem of Cisco BroadWorks could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to halt the processing of incoming SIP requests, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper memory handling for certain SIP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of SIP requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the memory that was allocated to the Cisco BroadWorks Network Servers that handle SIP traffic. If no memory is available, the Network Servers can no longer process incoming requests, resulting in a DoS condition that requires manual intervention to recover.","references":["https://blog.clamav.net/2025/01/clamav-142-and-108-security-patch.html","https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bw-sip-dos-mSySbrmt","https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-clamav-ole2-H549rphA"]}
