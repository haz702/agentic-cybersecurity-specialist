{"id":"CVE-2021-25094","publishedDate":"2022-04-25T16:16:07.117","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The Tatsu WordPress plugin before 3.3.12 add_custom_font action can be used without prior authentication to upload a rogue zip file which is uncompressed under the WordPress's upload directory. By adding a PHP shell with a filename starting with a dot \".\", this can bypass extension control implemented in the plugin. Moreover, there is a race condition in the zip extraction process which makes the shell file live long enough on the filesystem to be callable by an attacker.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167190/WordPress-Tatsu-Builder-Remote-Code-Execution.html","https://darkpills.com/wordpress-tatsu-builder-preauth-rce-cve-2021-25094/","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/fb0097a0-5d7b-4e5b-97de-aacafa8fffcd","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167190/WordPress-Tatsu-Builder-Remote-Code-Execution.html","https://darkpills.com/wordpress-tatsu-builder-preauth-rce-cve-2021-25094/","https://packetstorm.news/files/id/190566/","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/fb0097a0-5d7b-4e5b-97de-aacafa8fffcd","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52260"]}
