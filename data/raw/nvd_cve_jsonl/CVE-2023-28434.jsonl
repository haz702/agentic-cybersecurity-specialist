{"id":"CVE-2023-28434","publishedDate":"2023-03-22T21:15:18.427","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. Prior to RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z, an attacker can use crafted requests to bypass metadata bucket name checking and put an object into any bucket while processing `PostPolicyBucket`. To carry out this attack, the attacker requires credentials with `arn:aws:s3:::*` permission, as well as enabled Console API access. This issue has been patched in RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z. As a workaround, enable browser API access and turn off `MINIO_BROWSER=off`. \n","references":["https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/67f4ba154a27a1b06e48bfabda38355a010dfca5","https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/16849","https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-2pxw-r47w-4p8c","https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/67f4ba154a27a1b06e48bfabda38355a010dfca5","https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/16849","https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-2pxw-r47w-4p8c"]}
