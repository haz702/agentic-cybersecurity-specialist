{"id":"CVE-2024-7143","publishedDate":"2024-08-07T17:15:52.337","cvssV3":8.3,"description":"A flaw was found in the Pulp package. When a role-based access control (RBAC) object in Pulp is set to assign permissions on its creation, it uses the `AutoAddObjPermsMixin` (typically the add_roles_for_object_creator method). This method finds the object creator by checking the current authenticated user. For objects that are created within a task, this current user is set by the first user with any permissions on the task object. This means the oldest user with model/domain-level task permissions will always be set as the current user of a task, even if they didn't dispatch the task. Therefore, all objects created in tasks will have their permissions assigned to this oldest user, and the creating user will receive nothing.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6765","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7143","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2300125","https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/blob/93f241f34c503da0fbac94bdba739feda2636e12/pulpcore/tasking/_util.py#L108","https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/blob/main/CHANGES.md"]}
