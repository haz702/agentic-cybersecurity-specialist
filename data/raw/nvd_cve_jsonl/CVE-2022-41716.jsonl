{"id":"CVE-2022-41716","publishedDate":"2022-11-02T16:15:11.150","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Due to unsanitized NUL values, attackers may be able to maliciously set environment variables on Windows. In syscall.StartProcess and os/exec.Cmd, invalid environment variable values containing NUL values are not properly checked for. A malicious environment variable value can exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment variable. For example, the environment variable string \"A=B\\x00C=D\" sets the variables \"A=B\" and \"C=D\".","references":["https://go.dev/cl/446916","https://go.dev/issue/56284","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/mbHY1UY3BaM/m/hSpmRzk-AgAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1095","https://go.dev/cl/446916","https://go.dev/issue/56284","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/mbHY1UY3BaM/m/hSpmRzk-AgAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1095","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230120-0007/"]}
