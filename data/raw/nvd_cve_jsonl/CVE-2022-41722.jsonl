{"id":"CVE-2022-41722","publishedDate":"2023-02-28T18:15:09.887","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in filepath.Clean on Windows. On Windows, the filepath.Clean function could transform an invalid path such as \"a/../c:/b\" into the valid path \"c:\\b\". This transformation of a relative (if invalid) path into an absolute path could enable a directory traversal attack. After fix, the filepath.Clean function transforms this path into the relative (but still invalid) path \".\\c:\\b\".","references":["https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568","https://go.dev/cl/468123","https://go.dev/issue/57274","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1568"]}
