{"id":"CVE-2024-8791","publishedDate":"2024-09-24T03:15:03.547","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Donation Forms by Charitable \u2013 Donations Plugin & Fundraising Platform for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.1.14. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity when the ID parameter is supplied through the update_core_user() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the email address and password of arbitrary user accounts, including administrators, which can then be used to log in to those user accounts.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/charitable/tags/1.8.1.14/includes/users/class-charitable-user.php#L872","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3154009/charitable/trunk/includes/users/class-charitable-user.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0ee60943-b583-4a99-8e62-846b380c98aa?source=cve"]}
