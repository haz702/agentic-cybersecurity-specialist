{"id":"CVE-2024-47943","publishedDate":"2024-10-15T09:15:03.357","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The firmware upgrade function in the admin web interface of the Rittal\u00a0IoT Interface & CMC III Processing Unit devices checks if \nthe patch files are signed before executing the containing run.sh \nscript. The signing process is kind of an HMAC with a long string as key\n which is hard-coded in the firmware and is freely available for \ndownload. This allows crafting malicious \"signed\" .patch files in order \nto compromise the device and execute arbitrary code.","references":["https://r.sec-consult.com/rittaliot","https://www.rittal.com/de-de/products/deep/3124300"]}
