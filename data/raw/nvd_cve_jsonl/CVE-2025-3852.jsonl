{"id":"CVE-2025-3852","publishedDate":"2025-05-07T03:15:17.940","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The WPshop 2 \u2013 E-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in versions 2.0.0 to 2.6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email & password through the update() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpshop/tags/2.6.0//core/external/eo-framework/modules/wpeo-model/class/user.class.php#L132","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpshop/tags/2.6.0//modules/api/action/class-api-action.php#L32","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpshop/tags/2.6.0/core/external/eo-framework/modules/wpeo-model/class/rest.class.php#L41","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/96b8186c-dfe9-4137-b28d-cc09a25aa9ac?source=cve"]}
