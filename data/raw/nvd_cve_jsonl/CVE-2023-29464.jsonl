{"id":"CVE-2023-29464","publishedDate":"2023-10-13T13:15:11.453","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"\nFactoryTalk Linx, in the Rockwell Automation PanelView Plus, allows an unauthenticated threat actor to read data from memory via crafted malicious packets. Sending a size larger than the buffer size results in leakage of data from memory resulting in an information disclosure. If the size is large enough, it causes communications over the common industrial protocol to become unresponsive to any type of packet, resulting in a denial-of-service to FactoryTalk Linx over the common industrial protocol.\n\n","references":["https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1141040","https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1141040"]}
