This could enable low-privileged users to achieve NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges via a DeviceIoControl.","references":["https://gist.github.com/DStraghkov/fba4994ac4bb3a6e2940b21743563df0","https://www.asus.com/Static_WebPage/ASUS-Product-Security-Advisory/","https://gist.github.com/DStraghkov/fba4994ac4bb3a6e2940b21743563df0","https://www.asus.com/Static_WebPage/ASUS-Product-Security-Advisory/"]}
