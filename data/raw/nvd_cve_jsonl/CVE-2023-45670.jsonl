{"id":"CVE-2023-45670","publishedDate":"2023-10-30T23:15:08.543","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, the `config/save` and `config/set` endpoints of Frigate do not implement any CSRF protection. This makes it possible for a request sourced from another site to update the configuration of the Frigate server (e.g. via \"drive-by\" attack). Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. This issue can lead to arbitrary configuration updates for the Frigate server, resulting in denial of service and possible data exfiltration. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch.","references":["https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/09/07/why-are-developers-vulnerable-to-driveby-attacks/","https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/5658e5a4cc7376504af9de5e1eff178939a13e7f/frigate/http.py#L1060","https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/6aedc39a9a421cf48000a727f36b4c1495848a1d/frigate/http.py#L998","https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/discussions/8366","https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-xq49-hv88-jr6h","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-190_Frigate/","https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/09/07/why-are-developers-vulnerable-to-driveby-attacks/","https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/5658e5a4cc7376504af9de5e1eff178939a13e7f/frigate/http.py#L1060","https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/6aedc39a9a421cf48000a727f36b4c1495848a1d/frigate/http.py#L998","https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/discussions/8366","https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-xq49-hv88-jr6h","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-190_Frigate/"]}
