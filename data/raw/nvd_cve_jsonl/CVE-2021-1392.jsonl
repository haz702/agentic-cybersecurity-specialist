This vulnerability exists because incorrect permissions are associated with the show cip security CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing the command to retrieve the password for CIP on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reconfigure the device.","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-XE-SAP-OPLbze68","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-XE-SAP-OPLbze68"]}
