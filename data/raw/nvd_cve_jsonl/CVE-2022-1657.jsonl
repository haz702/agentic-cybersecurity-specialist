{"id":"CVE-2022-1657","publishedDate":"2022-06-13T14:15:08.363","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Vulnerable versions of the Jupiter (<= 6.10.1) and JupiterX (<= 2.0.6) Themes allow logged-in users, including subscriber-level users, to perform Path Traversal and Local File inclusion. In the JupiterX theme, the jupiterx_cp_load_pane_action AJAX action present in the lib/admin/control-panel/control-panel.php file calls the load_control_panel_pane function. It is possible to use this action to include any local PHP file via the slug parameter. The Jupiter theme has a nearly identical vulnerability which can be exploited via the mka_cp_load_pane_action AJAX action present in the framework/admin/control-panel/logic/functions.php file, which calls the mka_cp_load_pane_action function.","references":["https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2022/05/critical-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-jupiter-and-jupiterx-premium-themes/","https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2022/05/critical-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-jupiter-and-jupiterx-premium-themes/"]}
