{"id":"CVE-2021-36367","publishedDate":"2021-07-09T21:15:08.540","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"PuTTY through 0.75 proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it has never sent a substantive authentication response. This makes it easier for an attacker-controlled SSH server to present a later spoofed authentication prompt (that the attacker can use to capture credential data, and use that data for purposes that are undesired by the client user).","references":["https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=1dc5659aa62848f0aeb5de7bd3839fecc7debefa","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00016.html","https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/changes.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5588","https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=1dc5659aa62848f0aeb5de7bd3839fecc7debefa","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00016.html","https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/changes.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5588"]}
