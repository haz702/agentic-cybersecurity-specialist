{"id":"CVE-2024-49960","publishedDate":"2024-10-21T18:15:17.187","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix timer use-after-free on failed mount\n\nSyzbot has found an ODEBUG bug in ext4_fill_super\n\nThe del_timer_sync function cancels the s_err_report timer,\nwhich reminds about filesystem errors daily. We should\nguarantee the timer is no longer active before kfree(sbi).\n\nWhen filesystem mounting fails, the flow goes to failed_mount3,\nwhere an error occurs when ext4_stop_mmpd is called, causing\na read I/O failure. This triggers the ext4_handle_error function\nthat ultimately re-arms the timer,\nleaving the s_err_report timer active before kfree(sbi) is called.\n\nFix the issue by canceling the s_err_report timer after calling ext4_stop_mmpd.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0ce160c5bdb67081a62293028dc85758a8efb22a","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/22e9b83f0f33bc5a7a3181769d1dccbf021f5b04","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7aac0c17a8cdf4a3236991c1e60435c6a984076c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9203817ba46ebba7c865c8de2aba399537b6e891","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b85569585d0154d4db1e4f9e3e6a4731d407feb0","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cf3196e5e2f36cd80dab91ffae402e13935724bc","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fa78fb51d396f4f2f80f8e96a3b1516f394258be"]}
