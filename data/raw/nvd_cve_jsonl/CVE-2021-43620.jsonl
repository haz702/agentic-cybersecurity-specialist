{"id":"CVE-2021-43620","publishedDate":"2021-11-15T05:15:07.913","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An issue was discovered in the fruity crate through 0.2.0 for Rust. Security-relevant validation of filename extensions is plausibly affected. Methods of NSString for conversion to a string may return a partial result. Because they call CStr::from_ptr on a pointer to the string buffer, the string is terminated at the first '\\0' byte, which might not be the end of the string.","references":["https://github.com/nvzqz/fruity/issues/14","https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/pull/1102","https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0123.html","https://github.com/nvzqz/fruity/issues/14","https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/pull/1102","https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0123.html"]}
