{"id":"CVE-2023-27583","publishedDate":"2023-03-13T21:15:14.130","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"PanIndex is a network disk directory index. In Panindex prior to version 3.1.3,  a hard-coded JWT key `PanIndex` is used. An attacker can use the hard-coded JWT key to sign JWT token and perform any actions as a user with admin privileges. Version 3.1.3 has a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may change the JWT key in the source code before compiling the project.\n  \n","references":["https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/commit/f7ec0c5739af055ad3a825a20294a5c01ada3302","https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/releases/tag/v3.1.3","https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/security/advisories/GHSA-82wq-gmw8-g87v","https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/commit/f7ec0c5739af055ad3a825a20294a5c01ada3302","https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/releases/tag/v3.1.3","https://github.com/px-org/PanIndex/security/advisories/GHSA-82wq-gmw8-g87v"]}
