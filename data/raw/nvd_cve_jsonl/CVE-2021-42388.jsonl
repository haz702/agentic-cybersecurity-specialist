{"id":"CVE-2021-42388","publishedDate":"2022-03-14T23:15:07.970","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"Heap out-of-bounds read in Clickhouse's LZ4 compression codec when parsing a malicious query. As part of the LZ4::decompressImpl() loop, a 16-bit unsigned user-supplied value ('offset') is read from the compressed data. The offset is later used in the length of a copy operation, without checking the lower bounds of the source of the copy operation.","references":["https://jfrog.com/blog/7-rce-and-dos-vulnerabilities-found-in-clickhouse-dbms","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00002.html","https://jfrog.com/blog/7-rce-and-dos-vulnerabilities-found-in-clickhouse-dbms","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00002.html"]}
