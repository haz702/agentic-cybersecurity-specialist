This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other \u201csafe\u201d file types can be uploaded and included.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kubio/tags/2.5.1/lib/integrations/third-party-themes/editor-hooks.php#L32","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2fb44c6e-520e-4a9f-9987-8b770feb710d?source=cve"]}
