{"id":"CVE-2025-3064","publishedDate":"2025-04-08T09:15:28.140","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The WPFront User Role Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the whitelist_options() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the default role option that can be leveraged for privilege escalation via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is only exploitable on multisite instances.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpfront-user-role-editor/trunk/includes/users/class-user-profile.php#L104","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpfront-user-role-editor/trunk/includes/users/class-user-profile.php#L399","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3266542/#file142","https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpfront-user-role-editor/#developers","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/efc7ad9f-714e-474c-87e8-ecbbdfabd550?source=cve"]}
