{"id":"CVE-2025-43950","publishedDate":"2025-04-22T18:16:01.517","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"DPMAdirektPro 4.1.5 is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking. It happens by placing a malicious DLL in a directory (in the absence of a legitimate DLL), which is then loaded by the application instead of the legitimate DLL. This causes the malicious DLL to load with the same privileges as the application, thus causing a privilege escalation.","references":["https://github.com/Henkel-CyberVM/CVEs/tree/main/CVE-2025-43950","https://www.dpma.de/english/services/efiling/dpmadirekt/downloads/index.html"]}
