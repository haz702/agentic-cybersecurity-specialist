{"id":"CVE-2024-52336","publishedDate":"2024-11-26T16:15:17.093","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A script injection vulnerability was identified in the Tuned package. The `instance_create()` D-Bus function can be called by locally logged-in users without authentication. This flaw allows a local non-privileged user to execute a D-Bus call with `script_pre` or `script_post` options that permit arbitrary scripts with their absolute paths to be passed. These user or attacker-controlled executable scripts or programs could then be executed by Tuned with root privileges that could allow attackers to local privilege escalation.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10384","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0879","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0880","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-52336","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2324540","https://security.opensuse.org/2024/11/26/tuned-instance-create.html","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/11/28/1","https://security.opensuse.org/2024/11/26/tuned-instance-create.html","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/11/28/2"]}
