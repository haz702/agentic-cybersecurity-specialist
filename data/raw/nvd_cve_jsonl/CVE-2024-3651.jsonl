{"id":"CVE-2024-3651","publishedDate":"2024-07-07T18:15:09.827","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A vulnerability was identified in the kjd/idna library, specifically within the `idna.encode()` function, affecting version 3.6. The issue arises from the function's handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to quadratic complexity and consequently, a denial of service condition. This vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a quadratic manner relative to the input size.","references":["https://github.com/kjd/idna/commit/1d365e17e10d72d0b7876316fc7b9ca0eebdd38d","https://huntr.com/bounties/93d78d07-d791-4b39-a845-cbfabc44aadb","https://github.com/kjd/idna/commit/1d365e17e10d72d0b7876316fc7b9ca0eebdd38d","https://huntr.com/bounties/93d78d07-d791-4b39-a845-cbfabc44aadb"]}
