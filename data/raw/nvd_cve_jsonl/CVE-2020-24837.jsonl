{"id":"CVE-2020-24837","publishedDate":"2021-02-10T16:15:13.630","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An integer underflow has been found in the latest version of ZCFees. The variables 'currPeriodIdx' and 'lastPeriodExecIdx' are both unsigned integers, and the result of the minus operation may be a negative integer which leads to an underflow. The attackers can modify the current timestamp of the transaction somehow and block the execution of the process function.","references":["https://etherscan.io/address/0x9d79c6e2a0222b9ac7bfabc447209c58fe9e0dcc#code","https://etherscan.io/address/0x9d79c6e2a0222b9ac7bfabc447209c58fe9e0dcc#code"]}
