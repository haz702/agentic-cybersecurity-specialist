{"id":"CVE-2022-2639","publishedDate":"2022-09-01T21:15:09.600","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"An integer coercion error was found in the openvswitch kernel module. Given a sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memory for a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size() function does not return -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write access. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084479","https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/cefa91b2332d7009bc0be5d951d6cbbf349f90f8","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2084479","https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/cefa91b2332d7009bc0be5d951d6cbbf349f90f8"]}
