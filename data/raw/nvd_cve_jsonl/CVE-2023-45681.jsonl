{"id":"CVE-2023-45681","publishedDate":"2023-10-21T00:15:09.607","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg vorbis files. A crafted file may trigger memory write past an allocated heap buffer in `start_decoder`. The root cause is a potential integer overflow in `sizeof(char*) * (f->comment_list_length)` which may make `setup_malloc` allocate less memory than required. Since there is another integer overflow an attacker may overflow it too to force `setup_malloc` to return 0 and make the exploit more reliable. This issue may lead to code execution.","references":["https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_vorbis.c#L3660-L3677","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2MHQQXX27ACLLYUQHWSL3DVCOGUK5ZA4/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2WRORYQ2Z2XXHPX36JHBUSDVY6IOMW2N/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LBIPXOBWUHPAH4QHMVP2AWWAPDDZDQ66/","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-145_GHSL-2023-151_stb_image_h/","https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/5736b15f7ea0ffb08dd38af21067c314d6a3aae9/stb_vorbis.c#L3660-L3677","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2MHQQXX27ACLLYUQHWSL3DVCOGUK5ZA4/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2WRORYQ2Z2XXHPX36JHBUSDVY6IOMW2N/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LBIPXOBWUHPAH4QHMVP2AWWAPDDZDQ66/","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-145_GHSL-2023-151_stb_image_h/"]}
