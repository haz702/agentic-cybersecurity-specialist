{"id":"CVE-2024-10275","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:16.107","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"In version 1.5.5 of lunary-ai/lunary, a vulnerability exists where admins, who do not have direct permissions to access billing resources, can change the permissions of existing users to include billing permissions. This can lead to a privilege escalation scenario where an administrator can manage billing, effectively bypassing the intended role-based access control. Only users with the 'owner' role should be allowed to invite members with billing permissions. This flaw allows admins to circumvent those restrictions, gaining unauthorized access and control over billing information, posing a risk to the organization\u2019s financial resources.","references":["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/8ba1b8ba2c2c30b1cec30eb5777c1fda670cbbfc","https://huntr.com/bounties/863ee34b-c4c6-4325-bf7a-82a7feebf88f"]}
