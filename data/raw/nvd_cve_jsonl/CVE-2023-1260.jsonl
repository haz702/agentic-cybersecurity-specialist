{"id":"CVE-2023-1260","publishedDate":"2023-09-24T01:15:42.707","cvssV3":8.0,"description":"An authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in kube-apiserver. This issue could allow a remote, authenticated attacker who has been given permissions \"update, patch\" the \"pods/ephemeralcontainers\" subresource beyond what the default is. They would then need to create a new pod or patch one that they already have access to. This might allow evasion of SCC admission restrictions, thereby gaining control of a privileged pod.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:3976","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4093","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4312","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4898","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5008","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1260","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2176267","https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-92hx-3mh6-hc49","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231020-0010/","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:3976","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4093","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4312","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:4898","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5008","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1260","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2176267","https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-92hx-3mh6-hc49","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231020-0010/"]}
