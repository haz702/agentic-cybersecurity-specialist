{"id":"CVE-2024-47821","publishedDate":"2024-10-25T23:15:02.530","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager. The folder `/.pyload/scripts` has scripts which are run when certain actions are completed, for e.g. a download is finished. By downloading a executable file to a folder in /scripts and performing the respective action, remote code execution can be achieved in versions prior to 0.5.0b3.dev87. A file can be downloaded to such a folder by changing the download folder to a folder in `/scripts` path and using the `/flashgot` API to download the file. This vulnerability allows an attacker with access to change the settings on a pyload server to execute arbitrary code and completely compromise the system. Version 0.5.0b3.dev87 fixes this issue.","references":["https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-w7hq-f2pj-c53g"]}
