{"id":"CVE-2022-24845","publishedDate":"2022-04-13T22:15:08.330","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In affected versions, the return of `<iface>.returns_int128()` is not validated to fall within the bounds of `int128`. This issue can result in a misinterpretation of the integer value and lead to incorrect behavior. As of v0.3.0, `<iface>.returns_int128()` is validated in simple expressions, but not complex expressions. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this issue.","references":["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/049dbdc647b2ce838fae7c188e6bb09cf16e470b","https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-j2x6-9323-fp7h","https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/049dbdc647b2ce838fae7c188e6bb09cf16e470b","https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-j2x6-9323-fp7h"]}
