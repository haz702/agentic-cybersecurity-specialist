{"id":"CVE-2022-28734","publishedDate":"2023-07-20T01:15:10.243","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"Out-of-bounds write when handling split HTTP headers; When handling split HTTP headers, GRUB2 HTTP code accidentally moves its internal data buffer point by one position. This can lead to a out-of-bound write further when parsing the HTTP request, writing a NULL byte past the buffer. It's conceivable that an attacker controlled set of packets can lead to corruption of the GRUB2's internal memory metadata.","references":["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-28734","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230825-0002/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/07/5","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-28734","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230825-0002/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/07/5"]}
