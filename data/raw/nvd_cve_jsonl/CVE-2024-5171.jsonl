This function can be reached via 3 callers:\n\n\n  *  Calling aom_img_alloc() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or align parameter may result in integer overflows in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned aom_image_t struct may be invalid.\n  *  Calling aom_img_wrap() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, or align parameter may result in integer overflows in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned aom_image_t struct may be invalid.\n  *  Calling aom_img_alloc_with_border() with a large value of the d_w, d_h, align, size_align, or border parameter may result in integer overflows in the calculations of buffer sizes and offsets and some fields of the returned aom_image_t struct may be invalid.","references":["https://issues.chromium.org/issues/332382766","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6HYUEHZ35ZPY2EONVZCGO6LPT3AMLZCP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U5NRNCEYS246CYGOR32MF7OGKWOWER22/","https://issues.chromium.org/issues/332382766","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00024.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6HYUEHZ35ZPY2EONVZCGO6LPT3AMLZCP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U5NRNCEYS246CYGOR32MF7OGKWOWER22/"]}
