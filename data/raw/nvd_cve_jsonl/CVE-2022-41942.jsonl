{"id":"CVE-2022-41942","publishedDate":"2022-11-22T19:15:18.017","cvssV3":7.9,"description":"Sourcegraph is a code intelligence platform. In versions prior to 4.1.0 a command Injection vulnerability existed in the gitserver service, present in all Sourcegraph deployments. This vulnerability was caused by a lack of input validation on the host parameter of the `/list-gitolite` endpoint. It was possible to send a crafted request to gitserver that would execute commands inside the container. Successful exploitation requires the ability to send local requests to gitserver. The issue is patched in version 4.1.0.","references":["https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/42553","https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-pfm3-23mh-6xjp","https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/42553","https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-pfm3-23mh-6xjp"]}
