{"id":"CVE-2022-24439","publishedDate":"2022-12-06T05:15:11.420","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"All versions of package gitpython are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper user input validation, which makes it possible to inject a maliciously crafted remote URL into the clone command. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible because the library makes external calls to git without sufficient sanitization of input arguments.","references":["https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/bec61576ae75803bc4e60d8de7a629c194313d1c/git/repo/base.py%23L1249","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00024.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AV5DV7GBLMOZT7U3Q4TDOJO5R6G3V6GH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IKMVYKLWX62UEYKAN64RUZMOIAMZM5JN/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PF6AXUTC5BO7L2SBJMCVKJSPKWY52I5R/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SJHN3QUXPJIMM6SULIR3PR34UFWRAE7X/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-01","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-GITPYTHON-3113858","https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/bec61576ae75803bc4e60d8de7a629c194313d1c/git/repo/base.py%23L1249","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00024.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AV5DV7GBLMOZT7U3Q4TDOJO5R6G3V6GH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IKMVYKLWX62UEYKAN64RUZMOIAMZM5JN/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PF6AXUTC5BO7L2SBJMCVKJSPKWY52I5R/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SJHN3QUXPJIMM6SULIR3PR34UFWRAE7X/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-01","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-GITPYTHON-3113858"]}
