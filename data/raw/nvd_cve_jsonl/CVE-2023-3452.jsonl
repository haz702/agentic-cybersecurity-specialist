{"id":"CVE-2023-3452","publishedDate":"2023-08-12T03:15:09.330","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Canto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 3.0.4 via the 'wp_abspath' parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server, provided that allow_url_include is enabled. Local File Inclusion is also possible, albeit less useful because it requires that the attacker be able to upload a malicious php file via FTP or some other means into a directory readable by the web server.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/canto/trunk/includes/lib/tree.php?rev=2841358#L5","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2951888/canto/trunk/includes/lib/tree.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a76077c6-700a-4d21-a930-b0d6455d959c?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/canto/trunk/includes/lib/tree.php?rev=2841358#L5","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2951888/canto/trunk/includes/lib/tree.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a76077c6-700a-4d21-a930-b0d6455d959c?source=cve"]}
