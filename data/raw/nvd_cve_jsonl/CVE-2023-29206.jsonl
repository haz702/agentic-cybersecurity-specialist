{"id":"CVE-2023-29206","publishedDate":"2023-04-15T16:15:07.270","cvssV3":9.0,"description":"XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. There was no check in the author of a JavaScript xobject or StyleSheet xobject added in a XWiki document, so until now it was possible for a user having only Edit Right to create such object and to craft a script allowing to perform some operations when executing by a user with appropriate rights. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9-rc-1 by only executing the script if the author of it has Script rights.","references":["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/fe65bc35d5672dd2505b7ac4ec42aec57d500fbb","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-cmvg-w72j-7phx","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19514","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19583","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9119","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/fe65bc35d5672dd2505b7ac4ec42aec57d500fbb","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-cmvg-w72j-7phx","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19514","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19583","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9119"]}
