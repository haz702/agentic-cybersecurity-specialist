{"id":"CVE-2024-47778","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:40.840","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read vulnerability has been discovered in gst_wavparse_adtl_chunk within gstwavparse.c. This vulnerability arises due to insufficient validation of the size parameter, which can exceed the bounds of the data buffer. As a result, an OOB read occurs in the following while loop. This vulnerability can result in reading up to 4GB of process memory or potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) when accessing invalid memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8042.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0027.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-258_Gstreamer/"]}
