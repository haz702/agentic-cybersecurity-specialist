{"id":"CVE-2020-10143","publishedDate":"2020-12-09T23:15:12.247","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Macrium Reflect includes an OpenSSL component that specifies an OPENSSLDIR variable as C:\\openssl\\. Macrium Reflect contains a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create the appropriate path to a specially-crafted openssl.cnf file to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.","references":["https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/760767","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/760767"]}
