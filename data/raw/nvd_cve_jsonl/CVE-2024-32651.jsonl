{"id":"CVE-2024-32651","publishedDate":"2024-04-26T00:15:08.550","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"changedetection.io is an open source web page change detection, website watcher, restock monitor and notification service. There is a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Jinja2 that allows Remote Command Execution on the server host. Attackers can run any system command without any restriction and they could use a reverse shell. The impact is critical as the attacker can completely takeover the server machine. This can be reduced if changedetection is behind a login page, but this isn't required by the application (not by default and not enforced).","references":["https://blog.hacktivesecurity.com/index.php/2024/05/08/cve-2024-32651-server-side-template-injection-changedetection-io/","https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/releases/tag/0.45.21","https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-4r7v-whpg-8rx3","https://www.onsecurity.io/blog/server-side-template-injection-with-jinja2","https://blog.hacktivesecurity.com/index.php/2024/05/08/cve-2024-32651-server-side-template-injection-changedetection-io/","https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/releases/tag/0.45.21","https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/security/advisories/GHSA-4r7v-whpg-8rx3","https://www.onsecurity.io/blog/server-side-template-injection-with-jinja2"]}
