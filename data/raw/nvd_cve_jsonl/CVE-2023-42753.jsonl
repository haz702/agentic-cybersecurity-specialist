{"id":"CVE-2023-42753","publishedDate":"2023-09-25T21:15:15.923","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"An array indexing vulnerability was found in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A missing macro could lead to a miscalculation of the `h->nets` array offset, providing attackers with the primitive to arbitrarily increment/decrement a memory buffer out-of-bound. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7370","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7379","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7382","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7389","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7411","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7418","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7539","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7558","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0089","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0113","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0134","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0340","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0346","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0347","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0371","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0376","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0378","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0402","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0403","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0412","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0461","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0562","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0563","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0593","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0999","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-42753","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2239843","https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q3/216","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175963/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0099-1.html","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7370","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7379","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7382","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7389","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7411","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7418","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7539","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7558","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0089","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0113","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0134","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0340","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0346","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0347","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0371","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0376","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0378","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0402","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0403","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0412","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0461","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0562","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0563","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0593","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0999","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-42753","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2239843","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00027.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html","https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q3/216","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/10"]}
