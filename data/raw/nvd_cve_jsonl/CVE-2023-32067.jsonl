{"id":"CVE-2023-32067","publishedDate":"2023-05-25T23:15:09.380","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. c-ares is vulnerable to denial of service. If a target resolver sends a query, the attacker forges a malformed UDP packet with a length of 0 and returns them to the target resolver. The target resolver erroneously interprets the 0 length as a graceful shutdown of the connection. This issue has been patched in version 1.19.1.","references":["https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/releases/tag/cares-1_19_1","https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/security/advisories/GHSA-9g78-jv2r-p7vc","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00034.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/B5Z5XFNXTNPTCBBVXFDNZQVLLIE6VRBY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UBFWILTA33LOSV23P44FGTQQIDRJHIY7/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240605-0004/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5419","https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/releases/tag/cares-1_19_1","https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/security/advisories/GHSA-9g78-jv2r-p7vc","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00034.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/B5Z5XFNXTNPTCBBVXFDNZQVLLIE6VRBY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UBFWILTA33LOSV23P44FGTQQIDRJHIY7/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240605-0004/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5419"]}
