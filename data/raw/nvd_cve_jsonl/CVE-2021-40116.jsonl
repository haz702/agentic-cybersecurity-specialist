An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP packet to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause through traffic to be dropped. Note: Only products with Snort3 configured and either a rule with Block with Reset or Interactive Block with Reset actions configured are vulnerable. Products configured with Snort2 are not vulnerable.","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-dos-RywH7ezM","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-dos-RywH7ezM"]}
