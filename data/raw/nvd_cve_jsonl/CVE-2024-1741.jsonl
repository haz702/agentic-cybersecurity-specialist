Despite being removed from an organization, these members can still perform operations on prompt templates by sending HTTP requests with their previously captured authorization token. This issue exposes organizations to unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive template data.","references":["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/d8e2e73efd53ab4e92cf47bbf4b639a9f08853d2","https://huntr.com/bounties/671bd040-1cc5-4227-8182-5904e9c5ed3b","https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/d8e2e73efd53ab4e92cf47bbf4b639a9f08853d2","https://huntr.com/bounties/671bd040-1cc5-4227-8182-5904e9c5ed3b"]}
