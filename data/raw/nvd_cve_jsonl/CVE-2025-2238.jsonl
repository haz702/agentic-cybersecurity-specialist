This is due to insufficient user_meta restrictions in the 'vikinger_user_meta_update_ajax' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to escalate their privileges to Administrator-level.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/vikinger-buddypress-and-gamipress-social-community/28612259","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9e0cba5b-5833-4c02-ac17-830994b0f207?source=cve"]}
