{"id":"CVE-2023-25565","publishedDate":"2023-02-14T18:15:13.263","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that implements NTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0, an incorrect free when decoding target information can trigger a denial of service. The error condition incorrectly assumes the `cb` and `sh` buffers contain a copy of the data that needs to be freed. However, that is not the case. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point. This will likely trigger an assertion failure in `free`, causing a denial-of-service. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.","references":["https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/c16100f60907a2de92bcb676f303b81facee0f64","https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0","https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q7f-wqcg-mvfg","https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/c16100f60907a2de92bcb676f303b81facee0f64","https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0","https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-7q7f-wqcg-mvfg"]}
