This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_account_details' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit the name, email address, and password of an administrator account via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/propertyhive/tags/2.0.19/includes/class-ph-ajax.php#L1089","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/propertyhive/tags/2.0.19/includes/class-ph-ajax.php#L976","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3152548/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/17c06c83-6707-4233-a1c3-ef4cdcf93982?source=cve"]}
