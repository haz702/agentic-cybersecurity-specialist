{"id":"CVE-2024-41817","publishedDate":"2024-07-29T16:15:05.360","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"ImageMagick is a free and open-source software suite, used for editing and manipulating digital images. The `AppImage` version `ImageMagick` might use an empty path when setting `MAGICK_CONFIGURE_PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables while executing, which might lead to arbitrary code execution by loading malicious configuration files or shared libraries in the current working directory while executing `ImageMagick`. The vulnerability is fixed in 7.11-36.","references":["https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3b22378a23d59d7517c43b65b1822f023df357a0/app-image/AppRun#L11-L14","https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/6526a2b28510ead6a3e14de711bb991ad9abff38","https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-8rxc-922v-phg8","https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/blob/3b22378a23d59d7517c43b65b1822f023df357a0/app-image/AppRun#L11-L14","https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/6526a2b28510ead6a3e14de711bb991ad9abff38","https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-8rxc-922v-phg8"]}
