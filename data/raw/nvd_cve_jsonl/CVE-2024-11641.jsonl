{"id":"CVE-2024-11641","publishedDate":"2025-01-26T12:15:27.137","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The VikBooking Hotel Booking Engine & PMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin access privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation allows attackers with subscriber-level privileges and above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3225861/vikbooking","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6eb6611d-7a4b-4ca8-b9cc-c156437e89b5?source=cve"]}
