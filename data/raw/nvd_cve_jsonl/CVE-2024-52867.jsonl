The vulnerability can be remediated within the product via certain pull, reconfigure, and restart actions. Both 5ab3c4c and 5582241 are needed to resolve the vulnerability.","references":["https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=558224140dab669cabdaebabff18504a066c48d4","https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/commit/?id=5ab3c4c1e43ebb637551223791db0ea3519986e1","https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2024/build-user-takeover-vulnerability/","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00016.html"]}
