{"id":"CVE-2022-3240","publishedDate":"2022-11-15T14:15:10.160","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The \"Follow Me Plugin\" plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the FollowMeIgniteSocialMedia_options_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/follow-me/trunk/follow-me.php#L261","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories-continued/#CVE-2022-3240","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/follow-me/trunk/follow-me.php#L261","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories-continued/#CVE-2022-3240"]}
