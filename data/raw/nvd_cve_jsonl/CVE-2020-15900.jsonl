{"id":"CVE-2020-15900","publishedDate":"2020-07-28T16:15:12.840","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A memory corruption issue was found in Artifex Ghostscript 9.50 and 9.52. Use of a non-standard PostScript operator can allow overriding of file access controls. The 'rsearch' calculation for the 'post' size resulted in a size that was too large, and could underflow to max uint32_t. This was fixed in commit 5d499272b95a6b890a1397e11d20937de000d31b.","references":["http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git%3Ba=log","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00004.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00006.html","https://artifex.com/security-advisories/CVE-2020-15900","https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=5d499272b95a6b890a1397e11d20937de000d31b","https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl/commit/5d499272b95a6b890a1397e11d20937de000d31b","https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl/commits/master/psi/zstring.c","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-20","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4445-1/","http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git%3Ba=log","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00004.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00006.html","https://artifex.com/security-advisories/CVE-2020-15900","https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=5d499272b95a6b890a1397e11d20937de000d31b","https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl/commit/5d499272b95a6b890a1397e11d20937de000d31b","https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl/commits/master/psi/zstring.c","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-20","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4445-1/"]}
