{"id":"CVE-2022-49413","publishedDate":"2025-02-26T07:01:17.800","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbfq: Update cgroup information before merging bio\n\nWhen the process is migrated to a different cgroup (or in case of\nwriteback just starts submitting bios associated with a different\ncgroup) bfq_merge_bio() can operate with stale cgroup information in\nbic. Thus the bio can be merged to a request from a different cgroup or\nit can result in merging of bfqqs for different cgroups or bfqqs of\nalready dead cgroups and causing possible use-after-free issues. Fix the\nproblem by updating cgroup information in bfq_merge_bio().","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2a1077f17169a6059992a0bbdb330e0abad1e6d9","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b06691af08b41dfd81052a3362514d9827b44bb1","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d9165200c5627a2cf4408eefabdf0058bdf95e1a","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/da9f3025d595956410ceaab2bea01980d7775948","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e8821f45612f2e6d9adb9c6ba0fb4184f57692aa","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ea591cd4eb270393810e7be01feb8fde6a34fbbe"]}
