{"id":"CVE-2024-10762","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:19.753","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"In lunary-ai/lunary before version 1.5.9, the /v1/evaluators/ endpoint allows users to delete evaluators of a project by sending a DELETE request. However, the route lacks proper access control, such as middleware to ensure that only users with appropriate roles can delete evaluator data. This vulnerability allows low-privilege users to delete evaluators data, causing permanent data loss and potentially hindering operations.","references":["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/91587496673da24cb7ddedfbbd6e602592b20ef6","https://huntr.com/bounties/23ab508e-d956-4861-b28f-0569d3b404a6"]}
