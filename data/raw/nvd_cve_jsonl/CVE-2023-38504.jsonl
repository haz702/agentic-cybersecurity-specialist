{"id":"CVE-2023-38504","publishedDate":"2023-07-27T19:15:10.117","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Sails is a realtime MVC Framework for Node.js. In Sails apps prior to version 1.5.7,, an attacker can send a virtual request that will cause the node process to crash. This behavior was fixed in Sails v1.5.7.
