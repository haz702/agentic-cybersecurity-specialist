{"id":"CVE-2020-25613","publishedDate":"2020-10-06T13:15:13.823","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An issue was discovered in Ruby through 2.5.8, 2.6.x through 2.6.6, and 2.7.x through 2.7.1. WEBrick, a simple HTTP server bundled with Ruby, had not checked the transfer-encoding header value rigorously. An attacker may potentially exploit this issue to bypass a reverse proxy (which also has a poor header check), which may lead to an HTTP Request Smuggling attack.","references":["https://github.com/ruby/webrick/commit/8946bb38b4d87549f0d99ed73c62c41933f97cc7","https://hackerone.com/reports/965267","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00033.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PFP3E7KXXT3H3KA6CBZPUOGA5VPFARRJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YTZURYROG3FFED3TYCQOBV66BS4K6WOV/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-27","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210115-0008/","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/09/29/http-request-smuggling-cve-2020-25613/","https://github.com/ruby/webrick/commit/8946bb38b4d87549f0d99ed73c62c41933f97cc7","https://hackerone.com/reports/965267","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00033.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PFP3E7KXXT3H3KA6CBZPUOGA5VPFARRJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YTZURYROG3FFED3TYCQOBV66BS4K6WOV/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-27","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210115-0008/","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/09/29/http-request-smuggling-cve-2020-25613/"]}
