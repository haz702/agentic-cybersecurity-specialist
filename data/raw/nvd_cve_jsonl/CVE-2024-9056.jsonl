{"id":"CVE-2024-9056","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:46.453","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"BentoML version v1.3.4post1 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability can be exploited by appending characters, such as dashes (-), to the end of a multipart boundary in an HTTP request. This causes the server to continuously process each character, leading to excessive resource consumption and rendering the service unavailable. The issue is unauthenticated and does not require any user interaction, impacting all users of the service.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/a24a13c2-0300-4a95-b26a-ac7fe8f6521b"]}
