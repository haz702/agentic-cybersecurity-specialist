{"id":"CVE-2022-45544","publishedDate":"2023-02-07T16:15:08.607","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Insecure Permission vulnerability in Schlix Web Inc SCHLIX CMS 2.2.7-2 allows attacker to upload arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code via the tristao parameter. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because an admin is intentionally allowed to upload new executable PHP code, such as a theme that was obtained from a trusted source or was developed for their own website. Only an admin can upload such code, not someone else in an \"attacker\" role.","references":["https://blog.tristaomarinho.com/schlix-cms-2-2-7-2-arbitrary-file-upload/","https://github.com/tristao-marinho/CVE-2022-45544/blob/main/README.md","https://www.schlix.com/","https://www.schlix.com/downloads/schlix-cms/schlix-cms-v2.2.7-2.zip","https://blog.tristaomarinho.com/schlix-cms-2-2-7-2-arbitrary-file-upload/","https://github.com/tristao-marinho/CVE-2022-45544/blob/main/README.md","https://www.schlix.com/","https://www.schlix.com/downloads/schlix-cms/schlix-cms-v2.2.7-2.zip"]}
