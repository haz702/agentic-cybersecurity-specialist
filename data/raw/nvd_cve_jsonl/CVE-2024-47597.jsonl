{"id":"CVE-2024-47597","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:31.137","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An OOB-read has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_samples within qtdemux.c. This issue arises when the function qtdemux_parse_samples reads data beyond the boundaries of the stream->stco buffer. The following code snippet shows the call to qt_atom_parser_get_offset_unchecked, which leads to the OOB-read when parsing the provided GHSL-2024-245_crash1.mp4 file. This issue may lead to read up to 8 bytes out-of-bounds. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8059.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0012.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-245_Gstreamer/"]}
