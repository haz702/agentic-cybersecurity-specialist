{"id":"CVE-2023-51219","publishedDate":"2024-06-03T20:15:08.810","cvssV3":9.6,"description":"A deep link validation issue in KakaoTalk 10.4.3 allowed a remote adversary to direct users to run any attacker-controlled JavaScript within a WebView. The impact was further escalated by triggering another WebView that leaked its access token in a HTTP request header. Ultimately, this access token could be used to take over another user's account and read her/his chat messages.","references":["https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40776880","https://stulle123.github.io/posts/kakaotalk-account-takeover/","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40776880","https://stulle123.github.io/posts/kakaotalk-account-takeover/"]}
