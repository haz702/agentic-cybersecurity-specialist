{"id":"CVE-2021-4368","publishedDate":"2023-06-07T02:15:14.783","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authenticated Settings Change in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking capability checks and a security nonce, all on the wpfm_save_settings AJAX action. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to edit the plugin settings, such as the allowed upload file types.  This can lead to remote code execution through other vulnerabilities.","references":["https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-frontend-file-manager-plugin-fixed-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2554359%40nmedia-user-file-uploader&new=2554359%40nmedia-user-file-uploader&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/adb1d8b0-b1d6-40df-b591-f1062ee744fb?source=cve","https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-frontend-file-manager-plugin-fixed-multiple-critical-vulnerabilities/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2554359%40nmedia-user-file-uploader&new=2554359%40nmedia-user-file-uploader&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/adb1d8b0-b1d6-40df-b591-f1062ee744fb?source=cve"]}
