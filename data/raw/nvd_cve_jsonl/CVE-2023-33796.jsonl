{"id":"CVE-2023-33796","publishedDate":"2023-05-24T20:15:10.827","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"A vulnerability in Netbox v3.5.1 allows unauthenticated attackers to execute queries against the GraphQL database, granting them access to sensitive data stored in the database. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the reporter's only query was for the schema of the API, which is public; queries for database objects would have been denied.","references":["https://github.com/anhdq201/netbox/issues/16","https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/discussions/12729#discussioncomment-6008669","https://github.com/anhdq201/netbox/issues/16","https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/discussions/12729#discussioncomment-6008669"]}
