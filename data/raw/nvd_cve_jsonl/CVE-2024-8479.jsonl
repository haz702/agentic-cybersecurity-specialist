{"id":"CVE-2024-8479","publishedDate":"2024-09-14T04:15:04.733","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"The The Simple Spoiler plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in versions 1.2 to 1.3. This is due to the plugin adding the filter add_filter('comment_text', 'do_shortcode'); which will run all shortcodes in comments. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/simple-spoiler/trunk/simple-spoiler.php#L108","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3151179%40simple-spoiler&new=3151179%40simple-spoiler&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8ffc76d8-b841-4c26-bbc6-1f96664efe36?source=cve"]}
