{"id":"CVE-2025-21785","publishedDate":"2025-02-27T03:15:19.350","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: cacheinfo: Avoid out-of-bounds write to cacheinfo array\n\nThe loop that detects/populates cache information already has a bounds\ncheck on the array size but does not account for cache levels with\nseparate data/instructions cache. Fix this by incrementing the index\nfor any populated leaf (instead of any populated level).","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4371ac7b494e933fffee2bd6265d18d73c4f05aa","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4ff25f0b18d1d0174c105e4620428bcdc1213860","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/67b99a2b5811df4294c2ad50f9bff3b6a08bd618","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/715eb1af64779e1b1aa0a7b2ffb81414d9f708e5","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/875d742cf5327c93cba1f11e12b08d3cce7a88d2","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/88a3e6afaf002250220793df99404977d343db14","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ab90894f33c15b14c1cee6959ab6c8dcb09127f8","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e4fde33107351ec33f1a64188612fbc6ca659284"]}
