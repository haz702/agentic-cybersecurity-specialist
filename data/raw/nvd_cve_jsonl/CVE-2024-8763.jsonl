{"id":"CVE-2024-8763","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:43.867","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the lunary-ai/lunary repository, specifically in the compileTextTemplate function. The affected version is git be54057. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the regular expression /{{(.*?)}}/g, causing the server to hang indefinitely and become unresponsive to any requests. This is due to the regular expression's susceptibility to second-degree polynomial time complexity, which can be triggered by a large number of braces in the input.","references":["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/7ff89b0304d191534b924cf063f3648206d497fa","https://huntr.com/bounties/4fb63a6e-0056-4550-a34d-e161de1c13b8"]}
