Specifically, a user with a 'Member' role can issue a request to regenerate the private key of a project without having the necessary permissions or being assigned to that project. This issue was fixed in version 1.2.7.","references":["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/c57cd50fa0477fd2a2efe60810c0099eebd66f54","https://huntr.com/bounties/739df024-a112-47aa-b51d-988c3f855e92"]}
