{"id":"CVE-2024-38630","publishedDate":"2024-06-21T11:15:11.810","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwatchdog: cpu5wdt.c: Fix use-after-free bug caused by cpu5wdt_trigger\n\nWhen the cpu5wdt module is removing, the origin code uses del_timer() to\nde-activate the timer. If the timer handler is running, del_timer() could\nnot stop it and will return directly. If the port region is released by\nrelease_region() and then the timer handler cpu5wdt_trigger() calls outb()\nto write into the region that is released, the use-after-free bug will\nhappen.\n\nChange del_timer() to timer_shutdown_sync() in order that the timer handler\ncould be finished before the port region is released.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/573601521277119f2e2ba5f28ae6e87fc594f4d4","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b1c063ffc075abf56f63e55d70b9778ff534314","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f19686d616500cd0d47b30cee82392b53f7f784a","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/573601521277119f2e2ba5f28ae6e87fc594f4d4","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b1c063ffc075abf56f63e55d70b9778ff534314","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f19686d616500cd0d47b30cee82392b53f7f784a"]}
