{"id":"CVE-2024-20480","publishedDate":"2024-09-25T17:15:17.787","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"A vulnerability in the DHCP Snooping feature of Cisco IOS XE Software on Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) fabric edge nodes could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition that requires a manual reload to recover.  \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to improper handling of IPv4 DHCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain IPv4 DHCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust CPU resources and stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition that requires a manual reload to recover.","references":["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-xe-sda-edge-dos-MBcbG9k"]}
