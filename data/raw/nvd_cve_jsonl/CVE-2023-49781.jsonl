Prior to 0.202.9, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists within the Formula virtual cell comments functionality. The nc-gui/components/virtual-cell/Formula.vue displays a v-html tag with the value of \"urls\" whose contents are processed by the function replaceUrlsWithLink(). This function recognizes the pattern URI::(XXX) and creates a hyperlink tag <a> with href=XXX. However, it leaves all the other contents outside of the pattern URI::(XXX) unchanged. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.202.9.\n","references":["https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/commit/7f58ce3726dfec71537d8b80474a0f95a48a1574","https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/security/advisories/GHSA-h6r4-xvw6-jc5h","https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/commit/7f58ce3726dfec71537d8b80474a0f95a48a1574","https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/security/advisories/GHSA-h6r4-xvw6-jc5h"]}
