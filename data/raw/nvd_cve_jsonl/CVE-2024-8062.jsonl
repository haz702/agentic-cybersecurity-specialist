{"id":"CVE-2024-8062","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:40.627","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A vulnerability in the typeahead endpoint of h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0 allows for a denial of service. The endpoint performs a `HEAD` request to verify the existence of a specified resource without setting a timeout. An attacker can exploit this by sending multiple requests to an attacker-controlled server that hangs, causing the application to block and become unresponsive to other requests.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/a04190d9-4acb-449a-9a7f-f1bf6be1ed23","https://huntr.com/bounties/a04190d9-4acb-449a-9a7f-f1bf6be1ed23"]}
