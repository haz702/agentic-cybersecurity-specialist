{"id":"CVE-2025-24970","publishedDate":"2025-02-10T22:15:38.057","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Netty, an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework, has a vulnerability starting in version 4.1.91.Final and prior to version 4.1.118.Final. When a special crafted packet is received via SslHandler it doesn't correctly handle validation of such a packet in all cases which can lead to a native crash. Version 4.1.118.Final contains a patch. As workaround its possible to either disable the usage of the native SSLEngine or change the code manually.","references":["https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/87f40725155b2f89adfde68c7732f97c153676c4","https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0005/","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-24970-netty-vulnerability-detection","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-24970-netty-vulnerability-mitigation","https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw"]}
