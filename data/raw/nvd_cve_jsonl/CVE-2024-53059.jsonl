The size of the response packet is not validated.\n2. The response buffer is not freed.\n\nResolve these issues by switching to iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status(),\nwhich handles both size validation and frees the buffer.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/07a6e3b78a65f4b2796a8d0d4adb1a15a81edead","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3eb986c64c6bfb721950f9666a3b723cf65d043f","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3f45d590ccbae6dfd6faef54efe74c30bd85d3da","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/45a628911d3c68e024eed337054a0452b064f450","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/64d63557ded6ff3ce72b18ab87a6c4b1b652161c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9480c3045f302f43f9910d2d556d6cf5a62c1822","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9c98ee7ea463a838235e7a0e35851b38476364f2"]}
