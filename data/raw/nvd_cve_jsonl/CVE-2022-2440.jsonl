{"id":"CVE-2022-2440","publishedDate":"2024-08-29T11:15:23.790","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'images_array' parameter in versions up to, and including 2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/theme-editor/trunk/ms_child_theme_editor.php#L495","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3142694/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/88fe46bf-8e85-4550-92ad-bdd426e5a745?source=cve"]}
