{"id":"CVE-2023-6826","publishedDate":"2023-12-15T08:15:46.120","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The E2Pdf plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation on the 'import_action' function in versions up to, and including, 1.20.25. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with a role that the administrator previously granted access to the plugin, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/e2pdf/trunk/classes/controller/e2pdf-templates.php?rev=2993824#L1488","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/e2pdf/trunk/classes/controller/e2pdf-templates.php?rev=2993824#L753","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3009695/e2pdf#file0","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/03faec37-2cce-4e14-92f2-d941ab1b4ce9?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/e2pdf/trunk/classes/controller/e2pdf-templates.php?rev=2993824#L1488","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/e2pdf/trunk/classes/controller/e2pdf-templates.php?rev=2993824#L753","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3009695/e2pdf#file0","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/03faec37-2cce-4e14-92f2-d941ab1b4ce9?source=cve"]}
