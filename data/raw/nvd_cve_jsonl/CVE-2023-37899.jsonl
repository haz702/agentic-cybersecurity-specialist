{"id":"CVE-2023-37899","publishedDate":"2023-07-19T20:15:10.807","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Feathersjs is a framework for creating web APIs and real-time applications with TypeScript or JavaScript. Feathers socket handler did not catch invalid string conversion errors like `const message = ${{ toString: '' }}` which would cause the NodeJS process to crash when sending an unexpected Socket.io message like `socket.emit('find', { toString: '' })`.  A fix has been released in versions 5.0.8 and 4.5.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this vulnerability.","references":["https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/crow/CHANGELOG.md#4518-2023-07-19","https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/dove/CHANGELOG.md#508-2023-07-19","https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/pull/3241","https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/pull/3242","https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/security/advisories/GHSA-hhr9-rh25-hvf9","https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/crow/CHANGELOG.md#4518-2023-07-19","https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/blob/dove/CHANGELOG.md#508-2023-07-19","https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/pull/3241","https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/pull/3242","https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/security/advisories/GHSA-hhr9-rh25-hvf9"]}
