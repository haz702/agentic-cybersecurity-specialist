An improper escaping of the shell command, while calling the ansible_runner.interface.run_command, can lead to parameters getting executed as host's shell command. A developer could unintentionally write code that gets executed in the host rather than the virtual environment.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4041","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028074","https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/commit/3533f265f4349a3f2a0283158cd01b59a6bbc7bd","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4041","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028074","https://github.com/ansible/ansible-runner/commit/3533f265f4349a3f2a0283158cd01b59a6bbc7bd"]}
