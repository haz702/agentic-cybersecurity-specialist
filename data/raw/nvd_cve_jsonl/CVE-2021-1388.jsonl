The vulnerability is due to improper token validation on a specific API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the affected API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to receive a token with administrator-level privileges that could be used to authenticate to the API on affected MSO and managed Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices.","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-mso-authbyp-bb5GmBQv","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-mso-authbyp-bb5GmBQv"]}
