{"id":"CVE-2024-47542","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:28.630","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference has been discovered in the id3v2_read_synch_uint function, located in id3v2.c. If id3v2_read_synch_uint is called with a null work->hdr.frame_data, the pointer guint8 *data is accessed without validation, resulting in a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8033.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0008.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-235_Gstreamer/"]}
