This is due to insufficient restrictions on user meta that can be updated through the save_multiple_shipping_addresses() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woocommerce-multiple-addresses/trunk/class-woocommerce-multiple-addresses.php#L522","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/95e74e70-9dc9-4e63-b371-fd2a38692907?source=cve"]}
