{"id":"CVE-2020-24231","publishedDate":"2020-10-05T16:15:12.347","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Symmetric DS <3.12.0 uses mx4j to provide access to JMX over HTTP. mx4j, by default, has no auth and is available on all interfaces. An attacker can interact with JMX: get system info, and invoke MBean methods. It is possible to install additional MBeans from a remote host using MLet that leads to arbitrary code execution.","references":["https://www.symmetricds.org/issues/view.php?id=4263","https://www.symmetricds.org/issues/view.php?id=4263"]}
