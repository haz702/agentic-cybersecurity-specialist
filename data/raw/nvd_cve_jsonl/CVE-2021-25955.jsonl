{"id":"CVE-2021-25955","publishedDate":"2021-08-15T21:15:06.907","cvssV3":9.0,"description":"In \u201cDolibarr ERP CRM\u201d, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the \u201cPrivate Note\u201d field at \u201c/adherents/note.php?id=1\u201d endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.","references":["https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/commit/796b2d201acb9938b903fb2afa297db289ecc93e","https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2021-25955","https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/commit/796b2d201acb9938b903fb2afa297db289ecc93e","https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2021-25955"]}
