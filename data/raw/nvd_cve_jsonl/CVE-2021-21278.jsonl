{"id":"CVE-2021-21278","publishedDate":"2021-01-26T21:15:12.673","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"RSSHub is an open source, easy to use, and extensible RSS feed generator. In RSSHub before version 7f1c430 (non-semantic versioning) there is a risk of code injection. Some routes use `eval` or `Function constructor`, which may be injected by the target site with unsafe code, causing server-side security issues The fix in version 7f1c430 is to temporarily remove the problematic route and added a `no-new-func` rule to eslint.","references":["https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commit/7f1c43094e8a82e4d8f036ff7d42568fed00699d","https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/security/advisories/GHSA-pgjj-866w-fc5c","https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsshub","https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commit/7f1c43094e8a82e4d8f036ff7d42568fed00699d","https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/security/advisories/GHSA-pgjj-866w-fc5c","https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsshub"]}
