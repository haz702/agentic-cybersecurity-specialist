{"id":"CVE-2024-1872","publishedDate":"2024-03-29T07:15:43.213","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Button plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.28 via deserialization of untrusted input in the button_shortcode function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/button/trunk/inc/shortcode.php#L22","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d3d26aa4-8bea-48e8-ad14-513690a31831?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/button/trunk/inc/shortcode.php#L22","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d3d26aa4-8bea-48e8-ad14-513690a31831?source=cve"]}
