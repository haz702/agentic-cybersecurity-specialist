{"id":"CVE-2025-22604","publishedDate":"2025-01-27T17:15:17.307","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"Cacti is an open source performance and fault management framework. Due to a flaw in multi-line SNMP result parser, authenticated users can inject malformed OIDs in the response. When processed by ss_net_snmp_disk_io() or ss_net_snmp_disk_bytes(), a part of each OID will be used as a key in an array that is used as part of a system command, causing a command execution vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.2.29.","references":["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/commit/c7e4ee798d263a3209ae6e7ba182c7b65284d8f0","https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-c5j8-jxj3-hh36"]}
