{"id":"CVE-2024-10626","publishedDate":"2024-11-09T04:15:03.747","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The WooCommerce Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete_uploaded_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 17.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).","references":["https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-support-ticket-system/17930050","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eeb2c829-579f-41e2-ad5f-8e4fc125d980?source=cve"]}
