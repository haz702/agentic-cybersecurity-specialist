{"id":"CVE-2025-2111","publishedDate":"2025-04-19T06:15:19.657","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The Insert Headers And Footers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'custom_plugin_set_option' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site. The 'WPBRIGADE_SDK__DEV_MODE' constant must be set to 'true' to exploit the vulnerability.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-headers-and-footers/trunk/lib/wpb-sdk/views/wpb-debug.php#L63","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-headers-and-footers/trunk/lib/wpb-sdk/views/wpb-debug.php#L69","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3276361/","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7b00d175-261d-46e3-bf3c-2d18f4e4972d?source=cve"]}
