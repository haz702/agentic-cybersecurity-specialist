{"id":"CVE-2023-40303","publishedDate":"2023-08-14T05:15:10.233","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"GNU inetutils before 2.5 may allow privilege escalation because of unchecked return values of set*id() family functions in ftpd, rcp, rlogin, rsh, rshd, and uucpd. This is, for example, relevant if the setuid system call fails when a process is trying to drop privileges before letting an ordinary user control the activities of the process.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/30/4","https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/inetutils/","https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/inetutils.git/commit/?id=e4e65c03f4c11292a3e40ef72ca3f194c8bffdd6","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00013.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00013.html","https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-inetutils/2023-07/msg00000.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/30/4","https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/inetutils/","https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/inetutils.git/commit/?id=e4e65c03f4c11292a3e40ef72ca3f194c8bffdd6","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00013.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00013.html","https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-inetutils/2023-07/msg00000.html"]}
