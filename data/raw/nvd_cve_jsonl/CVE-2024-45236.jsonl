{"id":"CVE-2024-45236","publishedDate":"2024-08-24T23:15:04.187","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An issue was discovered in Fort before 1.6.3. A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a signed object containing an empty signedAttributes field. Fort accesses the set's elements without sanitizing it first. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a crash can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead to compromised routing.","references":["https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/CVE.html"]}
