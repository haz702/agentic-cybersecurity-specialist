{"id":"CVE-2024-24747","publishedDate":"2024-01-31T22:15:54.813","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage. When someone creates an access key, it inherits the permissions of the parent key. Not only for `s3:*` actions, but also `admin:*` actions. Which means unless somewhere above in the access-key hierarchy, the `admin` rights are denied, access keys will be able to simply override their own `s3` permissions to something more permissive. The vulnerability is fixed in RELEASE.2024-01-31T20-20-33Z.","references":["https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/0ae4915a9391ef4b3ec80f5fcdcf24ee6884e776","https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2024-01-31T20-20-33Z","https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-xx8w-mq23-29g4","https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/0ae4915a9391ef4b3ec80f5fcdcf24ee6884e776","https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2024-01-31T20-20-33Z","https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-xx8w-mq23-29g4"]}
