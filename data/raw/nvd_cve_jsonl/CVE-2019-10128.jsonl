{"id":"CVE-2019-10128","publishedDate":"2021-03-19T20:15:12.973","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A vulnerability was found in postgresql versions 11.x prior to 11.3. The Windows installer for EnterpriseDB-supplied PostgreSQL does not lock down the ACL of the binary installation directory or the ACL of the data directory; it keeps the inherited ACL. In the default configuration, this allows a local attacker to read arbitrary data directory files, essentially bypassing database-imposed read access limitations. In plausible non-default configurations, an attacker having both an unprivileged Windows account and an unprivileged PostgreSQL account can cause the PostgreSQL service account to execute arbitrary code.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707102","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210430-0004/","https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1939/","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1707102","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210430-0004/","https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1939/"]}
