{"id":"CVE-2024-22019","publishedDate":"2024-02-20T02:15:50.983","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A vulnerability in Node.js HTTP servers allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request with chunked encoding, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS). The server reads an unbounded number of bytes from a single connection, exploiting the lack of limitations on chunk extension bytes. The issue can cause CPU and network bandwidth exhaustion, bypassing standard safeguards like timeouts and body size limits.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1","https://hackerone.com/reports/2233486","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0004/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1","https://hackerone.com/reports/2233486","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0004/"]}
