{"id":"CVE-2022-37434","publishedDate":"2022-08-05T07:15:07.240","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field. NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/37","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/38","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/41","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/42","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/05/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/09/1","https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/9271","https://github.com/ivd38/zlib_overflow","https://github.com/madler/zlib/blob/21767c654d31d2dccdde4330529775c6c5fd5389/zlib.h#L1062-L1063","https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/1eb7682f845ac9e9bf9ae35bbfb3bad5dacbd91d","https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/eff308af425b67093bab25f80f1ae950166bece1","https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/75b68c6e4db515f76df73af476eccf382bbcb00a/deps/zlib/inflate.c#L762-L764","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00012.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JWN4VE3JQR4O2SOUS5TXNLANRPMHWV4I/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NMBOJ77A7T7PQCARMDUK75TE6LLESZ3O/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PAVPQNCG3XRLCLNSQRM3KAN5ZFMVXVTY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X5U7OTKZSHY2I3ZFJSR2SHFHW72RKGDK/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YRQAI7H4M4RQZ2IWZUEEXECBE5D56BH2/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220901-0005/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0007/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213488","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213489","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213490","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213491","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213493","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213494","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5218","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/37","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/38","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/41","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/42","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/05/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/09/1","https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/9271","https://github.com/ivd38/zlib_overflow","https://github.com/madler/zlib/blob/21767c654d31d2dccdde4330529775c6c5fd5389/zlib.h#L1062-L1063","https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/eff308af425b67093bab25f80f1ae950166bece1","https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/75b68c6e4db515f76df73af476eccf382bbcb00a/deps/zlib/inflate.c#L762-L764","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00012.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JWN4VE3JQR4O2SOUS5TXNLANRPMHWV4I/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NMBOJ77A7T7PQCARMDUK75TE6LLESZ3O/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PAVPQNCG3XRLCLNSQRM3KAN5ZFMVXVTY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X5U7OTKZSHY2I3ZFJSR2SHFHW72RKGDK/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YRQAI7H4M4RQZ2IWZUEEXECBE5D56BH2/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220901-0005/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0007/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213488","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213489","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213490","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213491","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213493","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213494","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5218"]}
