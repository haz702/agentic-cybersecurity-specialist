{"id":"CVE-2024-13656","publishedDate":"2025-02-12T05:15:12.143","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"The Click Mag - Viral WordPress News Magazine/Blog Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on the propanel_of_ajax_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary option values on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to delete an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/click-mag-viral-wordpress-news-magazineblog-theme/18081003","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ee5df5fe-4213-4d36-aa8f-7eb2710c32b6?source=cve"]}
