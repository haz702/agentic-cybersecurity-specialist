{"id":"CVE-2023-50387","publishedDate":"2024-02-14T16:15:45.300","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the \"KeyTrap\" issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/16/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/16/3","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-50387","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1219823","https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2024-01.html","https://gitlab.nic.cz/knot/knot-resolver/-/releases/v5.7.1","https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-50387","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00006.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00011.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6FV5O347JTX7P5OZA6NGO4MKTXRXMKOZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BUIP7T7Z4T3UHLXFWG6XIVDP4GYPD3AI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVRDSJVZKMCXKKPP6PNR62T7RWZ3YSDZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IGSLGKUAQTW5JPPZCMF5YPEYALLRUZZ6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PNNHZSZPG2E7NBMBNYPGHCFI4V4XRWNQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RGS7JN6FZXUSTC2XKQHH27574XOULYYJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVYA42BLXUCIDLD35YIJPJSHDIADNYMP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TEXGOYGW7DBS3N2QSSQONZ4ENIRQEAPG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UQESRWMJCF4JEYJEAKLRM6CT55GLJAB7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZDZFMEKQTZ4L7RY46FCENWFB5MDT263R/","https://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2024q1/017430.html","https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-50387","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39367411","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39372384","https://nlnetlabs.nl/news/2024/Feb/13/unbound-1.19.1-released/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240307-0007/","https://www.athene-center.de/aktuelles/key-trap","https://www.athene-center.de/fileadmin/content/PDF/Technical_Report_KeyTrap.pdf","https://www.isc.org/blogs/2024-bind-security-release/","https://www.securityweek.com/keytrap-dns-attack-could-disable-large-parts-of-internet-researchers/","https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/13/dnssec_vulnerability_internet/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/16/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/16/3","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-50387","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1219823","https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2024-01.html","https://gitlab.nic.cz/knot/knot-resolver/-/releases/v5.7.1","https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-50387","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00006.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00011.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6FV5O347JTX7P5OZA6NGO4MKTXRXMKOZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BUIP7T7Z4T3UHLXFWG6XIVDP4GYPD3AI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVRDSJVZKMCXKKPP6PNR62T7RWZ3YSDZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IGSLGKUAQTW5JPPZCMF5YPEYALLRUZZ6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PNNHZSZPG2E7NBMBNYPGHCFI4V4XRWNQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RGS7JN6FZXUSTC2XKQHH27574XOULYYJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVYA42BLXUCIDLD35YIJPJSHDIADNYMP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TEXGOYGW7DBS3N2QSSQONZ4ENIRQEAPG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UQESRWMJCF4JEYJEAKLRM6CT55GLJAB7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZDZFMEKQTZ4L7RY46FCENWFB5MDT263R/","https://lists.thekelleys.org.uk/pipermail/dnsmasq-discuss/2024q1/017430.html","https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-50387","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39367411","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39372384","https://nlnetlabs.nl/news/2024/Feb/13/unbound-1.19.1-released/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240307-0007/","https://www.athene-center.de/aktuelles/key-trap","https://www.athene-center.de/fileadmin/content/PDF/Technical
