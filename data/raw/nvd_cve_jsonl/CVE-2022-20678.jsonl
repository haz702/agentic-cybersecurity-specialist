{"id":"CVE-2022-20678","publishedDate":"2022-04-15T15:15:12.467","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"A vulnerability in the AppNav-XE feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain TCP segments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted TCP traffic at a high rate through an interface of an affected device. That interface would need to have AppNav interception enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-appnav-xe-dos-j5MXTR4","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-appnav-xe-dos-j5MXTR4"]}
