{"id":"CVE-2022-25366","publishedDate":"2022-02-19T03:15:14.867","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"Cryptomator through 1.6.5 allows DYLIB injection because, although it has the flag 0x1000 for Hardened Runtime, it has the com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation and com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables entitlements. An attacker can exploit this by creating a malicious .dylib file that can be executed via the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable.","references":["https://cryptomator.org/","https://medium.com/%40tehwinsam/cryptomator-1-6-5-dylib-injection-8004a1e90b26","https://cryptomator.org/","https://medium.com/%40tehwinsam/cryptomator-1-6-5-dylib-injection-8004a1e90b26"]}
