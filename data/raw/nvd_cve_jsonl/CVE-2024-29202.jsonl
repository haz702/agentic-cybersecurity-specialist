Attackers can exploit a Jinja2 template injection vulnerability in JumpServer's Ansible to execute arbitrary code within the Celery container. Since the Celery container runs with root privileges and has database access, attackers could steal sensitive information from all hosts or manipulate the database. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.7.","references":["https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/security/advisories/GHSA-2vvr-vmvx-73ch","https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/diving-into-jumpserver-attackers-gateway-to-internal-networks-2-2","https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/security/advisories/GHSA-2vvr-vmvx-73ch"]}
