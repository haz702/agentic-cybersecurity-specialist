{"id":"CVE-2024-47602","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:31.893","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the gst_matroska_demux_add_wvpk_header function within matroska-demux.c. This function does not properly check the validity of the stream->codec_priv pointer in the following code. If stream->codec_priv is NULL, the call to GST_READ_UINT16_LE will attempt to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash of the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8057.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0019.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-250_Gstreamer/"]}
