{"id":"CVE-2020-27222","publishedDate":"2021-02-03T16:15:13.117","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In Eclipse Californium version 2.3.0 to 2.6.0, the certificate based (x509 and RPK) DTLS handshakes accidentally fails, because the DTLS server side sticks to a wrong internal state. That wrong internal state is set by a previous certificate based DTLS handshake failure with TLS parameter mismatch. The DTLS server side must be restarted to recover this. This allow clients to force a DoS.","references":["https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=570844","https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=570844"]}
