{"id":"CVE-2024-10550","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:17.390","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A vulnerability in the `/3/ParseSetup` endpoint of h2oai/h2o-3 version 3.46.0.1 allows for a denial of service (DoS) attack. The endpoint applies a user-specified regular expression to a user-controllable string. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause inefficient regular expression complexity, leading to the exhaustion of server resources and making the server unresponsive.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/ef3f4d89-3b8b-4618-b134-cb93c1664ec6"]}
