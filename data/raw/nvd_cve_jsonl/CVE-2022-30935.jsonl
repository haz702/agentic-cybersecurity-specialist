{"id":"CVE-2022-30935","publishedDate":"2022-09-28T11:15:09.593","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"An authorization bypass in b2evolution allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to predict password reset tokens for any user through the use of a bad randomness function. This allows the attacker to get valid sessions for arbitrary users, and optionally reset their password. Tested and confirmed in a default installation of version 7.2.3. Earlier versions are affected, possibly earlier major versions as well.","references":["https://b2evolution.net/downloads/7-2-5-stable","https://github.com/b2evolution/b2evolution/blob/master/inc/_core/_misc.funcs.php#L5955","https://github.com/b2evolution/b2evolution/issues/114","https://b2evolution.net/downloads/7-2-5-stable","https://github.com/b2evolution/b2evolution/blob/master/inc/_core/_misc.funcs.php#L5955","https://github.com/b2evolution/b2evolution/issues/114"]}
