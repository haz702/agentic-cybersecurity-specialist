{"id":"CVE-2022-28615","publishedDate":"2022-06-09T17:15:09.230","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose information due to a read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input buffer. While no code distributed with the server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/08/9","https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7QUGG2QZWHTITMABFLVXA4DNYUOTPWYQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YPY2BLEVJWFH34AX77ZJPLD2OOBYR6ND/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-20","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220624-0005/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/08/9","https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7QUGG2QZWHTITMABFLVXA4DNYUOTPWYQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YPY2BLEVJWFH34AX77ZJPLD2OOBYR6ND/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-20","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220624-0005/"]}
