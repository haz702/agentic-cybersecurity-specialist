{"id":"CVE-2021-43305","publishedDate":"2022-03-14T23:15:08.203","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Heap buffer overflow in Clickhouse's LZ4 compression codec when parsing a malicious query. There is no verification that the copy operations in the LZ4::decompressImpl loop and especially the arbitrary copy operation wildCopy<copy_amount>(op, ip, copy_end), don\u2019t exceed the destination buffer\u2019s limits. This issue is very similar to CVE-2021-43304, but the vulnerable copy operation is in a different wildCopy call.","references":["https://jfrog.com/blog/7-rce-and-dos-vulnerabilities-found-in-clickhouse-dbms","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00002.html","https://jfrog.com/blog/7-rce-and-dos-vulnerabilities-found-in-clickhouse-dbms","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00002.html"]}
