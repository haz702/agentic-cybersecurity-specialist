A specially crafted document can cause the document parser to sign-extend a length used to terminate a loop, which can later result in the loop\u2019s index being used to write outside the bounds of a heap buffer during the reading of file data. An attacker can entice the victim to open a document to trigger this vulnerability.","references":["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1161","https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1161"]}
