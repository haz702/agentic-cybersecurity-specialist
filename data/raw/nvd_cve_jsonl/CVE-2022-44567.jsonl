To exploit the vulnerability, the internal video chat window must be disabled or a Mac App Store build must be used (internalVideoChatWindow.ts#L14). The vulnerability may be exploited by an XSS attack because the function openInternalVideoChatWindow is exposed in the Rocket.Chat-Desktop-API.","references":["https://hackerone.com/reports/1781102","https://hackerone.com/reports/1781102"]}
