{"id":"CVE-2022-3787","publishedDate":"2023-03-29T21:15:07.903","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A vulnerability was found in the device-mapper-multipath. The device-mapper-multipath allows local users to obtain root access, exploited alone or in conjunction with CVE-2022-41973. Local users that are able to write to UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and manipulate the multipath setup. This issue occurs because an attacker can repeat a keyword, which is mishandled when arithmetic ADD is used instead of bitwise OR. This could lead to local privilege escalation to root.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2138959","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2138959"]}
