{"id":"CVE-2023-29404","publishedDate":"2023-06-08T21:15:17.077","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The go command may execute arbitrary code at build time when using cgo. This may occur when running \"go get\" on a malicious module, or when running any other command which builds untrusted code. This is can by triggered by linker flags, specified via a \"#cgo LDFLAGS\" directive. The arguments for a number of flags which are non-optional are incorrectly considered optional, allowing disallowed flags to be smuggled through the LDFLAGS sanitization. This affects usage of both the gc and gccgo compilers.","references":["https://go.dev/cl/501225","https://go.dev/issue/60305","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NZ2O6YCO2IZMZJELQGZYR2WAUNEDLYV6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XBS3IIK6ADV24C5ULQU55QLT2UE762ZX/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1841","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/501225","https://go.dev/issue/60305","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/q5135a9d924/m/j0ZoAJOHAwAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NZ2O6YCO2IZMZJELQGZYR2WAUNEDLYV6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XBS3IIK6ADV24C5ULQU55QLT2UE762ZX/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1841","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241115-0009/"]}
