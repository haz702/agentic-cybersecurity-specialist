{"id":"CVE-2024-8489","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:42.490","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A vulnerability in modelscope/agentscope, specifically in the AgentScope Studio backend server, allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to overly permissive CORS headers. This issue affects the latest commit on the main branch (21161fe). The vulnerability permits an attacker to access all backend endpoints, including the `api/file` endpoint, enabling the reading of arbitrary files on the target's local file system through CSRF.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/93195bf0-9ac2-4476-a2ea-7c9364727e8c"]}
