{"id":"CVE-2022-30262","publishedDate":"2022-08-17T15:15:08.260","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"The Emerson ControlWave 'Next Generation' RTUs through 2022-05-02 mishandle firmware integrity. They utilize the BSAP-IP protocol to transmit firmware updates. Firmware updates are supplied as CAB archive files containing a binary firmware image. In all cases, firmware images were found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks.","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-221-02","https://www.forescout.com/blog/","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-221-02","https://www.forescout.com/blog/"]}
