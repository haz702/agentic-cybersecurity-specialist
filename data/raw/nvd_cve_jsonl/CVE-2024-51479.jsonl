{"id":"CVE-2024-51479","publishedDate":"2024-12-17T19:15:06.697","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In affected versions if a Next.js application is performing authorization in middleware based on pathname, it was possible for this authorization to be bypassed for pages directly under the application's root directory. For example: * [Not affected] `https://example.com/` * [Affected] `https://example.com/foo` * [Not affected] `https://example.com/foo/bar`. This issue is patched in Next.js `14.2.15` and later. If your Next.js application is hosted on Vercel, this vulnerability has been automatically mitigated, regardless of Next.js version. There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.","references":["https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v14.2.15","https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-7gfc-8cq8-jh5f"]}
