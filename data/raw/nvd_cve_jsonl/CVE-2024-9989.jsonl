This is due a to limited arbitrary method call to 'crypto_connect_ajax_process::log_in' function in the 'crypto_connect_ajax_process' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/crypto/tags/2.10/includes/class-crypto_connect_ajax_register.php#L138","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/crypto/tags/2.10/includes/class-crypto_connect_ajax_register.php#L33","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e21bd924-1d96-4371-972a-5c99d67261cc?source=cve"]}
