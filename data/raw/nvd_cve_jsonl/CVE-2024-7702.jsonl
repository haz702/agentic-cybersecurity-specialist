{"id":"CVE-2024-7702","publishedDate":"2024-08-20T04:15:09.540","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the entryID parameter in versions 2.0 to 2.13.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user-supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries to already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bit-form/trunk/includes/Admin/AdminAjax.php#L944","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/07847ba1-cbce-4d81-bd24-46887ac31a5d?source=cve"]}
