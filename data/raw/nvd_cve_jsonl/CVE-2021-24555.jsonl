{"id":"CVE-2021-24555","publishedDate":"2021-08-23T12:15:09.900","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The daac_delete_booking_callback function, hooked to the daac_delete_booking AJAX action, takes the id POST parameter which is passed into the SQL statement without proper sanitisation, validation or escaping, leading to a SQL Injection issue. Furthermore, the ajax action is lacking any CSRF and capability check, making it available to any authenticated user.","references":["https://codevigilant.com/disclosure/2021/wp-plugin-diary-availability-calendar/","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/8eafd84b-6214-450b-869b-0afe7cca4c5f","https://codevigilant.com/disclosure/2021/wp-plugin-diary-availability-calendar/","https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/8eafd84b-6214-450b-869b-0afe7cca4c5f"]}
