{"id":"CVE-2024-26130","publishedDate":"2024-02-21T17:15:09.863","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. Starting in version 38.0.0 and prior to version 42.0.4, if `pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates` is called with both a certificate whose public key did not match the provided private key and an `encryption_algorithm` with `hmac_hash` set (via `PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)`, then a NULL pointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process. This has been resolved in version 42.0.4, the first version in which a `ValueError` is properly raised.","references":["https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/97d231672763cdb5959a3b191e692a362f1b9e55","https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/10423","https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/security/advisories/GHSA-6vqw-3v5j-54x4","https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/97d231672763cdb5959a3b191e692a362f1b9e55","https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/10423","https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/security/advisories/GHSA-6vqw-3v5j-54x4"]}
