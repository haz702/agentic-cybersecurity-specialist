{"id":"CVE-2024-11285","publishedDate":"2025-03-14T05:15:40.693","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The WP JobHunt plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 7.1. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email via the account_settings_callback() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/jobcareer-job-board-responsive-wordpress-theme/14221636","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0e61c98d-a6f4-4ac0-b9f9-2b936c030413?source=cve"]}
