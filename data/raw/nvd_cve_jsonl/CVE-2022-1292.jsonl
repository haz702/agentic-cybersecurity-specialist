{"id":"CVE-2022-1292","publishedDate":"2022-05-03T16:15:18.823","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd).","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-953464.pdf","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=1ad73b4d27bd8c1b369a3cd453681d3a4f1bb9b2","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=548d3f280a6e737673f5b61fce24bb100108dfeb","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=e5fd1728ef4c7a5bf7c7a7163ca60370460a6e23","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00019.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VX4KWHPMKYJL6ZLW4M5IU7E5UV5ZWJQU/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZNU5M7BXMML26G3GPYKFGQYPQDRSNKDD/","https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0011","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-02","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220602-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220729-0004/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5139","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20220503.txt","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-953464.pdf","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=1ad73b4d27bd8c1b369a3cd453681d3a4f1bb9b2","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=548d3f280a6e737673f5b61fce24bb100108dfeb","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=e5fd1728ef4c7a5bf7c7a7163ca60370460a6e23","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00019.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VX4KWHPMKYJL6ZLW4M5IU7E5UV5ZWJQU/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZNU5M7BXMML26G3GPYKFGQYPQDRSNKDD/","https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0011","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-02","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220602-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220729-0004/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5139","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20220503.txt","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"]}
