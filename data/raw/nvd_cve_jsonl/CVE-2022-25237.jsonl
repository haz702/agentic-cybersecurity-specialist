{"id":"CVE-2022-25237","publishedDate":"2022-06-02T14:15:40.153","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Bonita Web 2021.2 is affected by a authentication/authorization bypass vulnerability due to an overly broad exclude pattern used in the RestAPIAuthorizationFilter. By appending ;i18ntranslation or /../i18ntranslation/ to the end of a URL, users with no privileges can access privileged API endpoints. This can lead to remote code execution by abusing the privileged API actions.","references":["https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-web","https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/application-security/cve-2022-25237-bonitasoft-authorization-bypass/","https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-web","https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/application-security/cve-2022-25237-bonitasoft-authorization-bypass/"]}
