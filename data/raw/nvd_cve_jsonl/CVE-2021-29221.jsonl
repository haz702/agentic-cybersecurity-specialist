{"id":"CVE-2021-29221","publishedDate":"2021-04-09T14:15:12.910","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"A local privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in Erlang/OTP prior to version 23.2.3. By adding files to an existing installation's directory, a local attacker could hijack accounts of other users running Erlang programs or possibly coerce a service running with \"erlsrv.exe\" to execute arbitrary code as Local System. This can occur only under specific conditions on Windows with unsafe filesystem permissions.","references":["https://deepsurface.com/deepsurface-security-advisory-local-privilege-escalation-in-erlang-on-windows-cve-2021-29221/","https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-23.2.3","https://deepsurface.com/deepsurface-security-advisory-local-privilege-escalation-in-erlang-on-windows-cve-2021-29221/","https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-23.2.3"]}
