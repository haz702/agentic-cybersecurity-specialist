{"id":"CVE-2024-38528","publishedDate":"2024-06-28T20:15:02.533","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computer's clock, implementing the NTP and NTS protocols. There is a missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash ntpd-rs when an NTS-KE server is configured. Non NTS-KE server configurations, such as the default ntpd-rs configuration, are unaffected. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.3.\n","references":["https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-2xpx-vcmq-5f72","https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-2xpx-vcmq-5f72"]}
