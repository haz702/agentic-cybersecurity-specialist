{"id":"CVE-2024-47546","publishedDate":"2024-12-12T02:03:29.210","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in extract_cc_from_data function within qtdemux.c. In the FOURCC_c708 case, the subtraction atom_length - 8 may result in an underflow if atom_length is less than 8. When that subtraction underflows, *cclen ends up being a large number, and then cclen is passed to g_memdup2 leading to an out-of-bounds (OOB) read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.","references":["https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8059.patch","https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0013.html","https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-243_Gstreamer/"]}
