{"id":"CVE-2024-4958","publishedDate":"2024-06-01T08:15:08.637","cvssV3":7.1,"description":"The User Registration \u2013 Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'import_form_action' function in versions up to, and including, 3.2.0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to import a registration form with a default user role of administrator. If an administrator approves or publishes a post or page with the shortcode to the imported form, any user can register as an administrator.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3095484/user-registration/tags/3.2.1/includes/class-ur-ajax.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/710574a8-a6e2-4ee6-9ea7-03a34994fec7?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3095484/user-registration/tags/3.2.1/includes/class-ur-ajax.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/710574a8-a6e2-4ee6-9ea7-03a34994fec7?source=cve"]}
