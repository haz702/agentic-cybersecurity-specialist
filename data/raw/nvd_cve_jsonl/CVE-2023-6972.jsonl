{"id":"CVE-2023-6972","publishedDate":"2023-12-23T02:15:45.333","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.9 via the 'content-backups' and 'content-name', 'content-manifest', or 'content-bmitmp' and 'content-identy' HTTP headers. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/backup-backup/tags/1.3.9/includes/backup-heart.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/backup-backup/tags/1.3.9/includes/bypasser.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3012745/backup-backup","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0a3ae696-f67d-4ed2-b307-d2f36b6f188c?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/backup-backup/tags/1.3.9/includes/backup-heart.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/backup-backup/tags/1.3.9/includes/bypasser.php","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3012745/backup-backup","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0a3ae696-f67d-4ed2-b307-d2f36b6f188c?source=cve"]}
