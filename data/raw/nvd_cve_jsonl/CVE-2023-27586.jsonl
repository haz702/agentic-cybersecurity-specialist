{"id":"CVE-2023-27586","publishedDate":"2023-03-20T16:15:13.197","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"CairoSVG is an SVG converter based on Cairo, a 2D graphics library. Prior to version 2.7.0, Cairo can send requests to external hosts when processing SVG files. A malicious actor could send a specially crafted SVG file that allows them to perform a server-side request forgery or denial of service. Version 2.7.0 disables CairoSVG's ability to access other files online by default.","references":["https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/commit/12d31c653c0254fa9d9853f66b04ea46e7397255","https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/commit/33007d4af9195e2bfb2ff9af064c4c2d8e4b2b53","https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/releases/tag/2.7.0","https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/security/advisories/GHSA-rwmf-w63j-p7gv","https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/commit/12d31c653c0254fa9d9853f66b04ea46e7397255","https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/commit/33007d4af9195e2bfb2ff9af064c4c2d8e4b2b53","https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/releases/tag/2.7.0","https://github.com/Kozea/CairoSVG/security/advisories/GHSA-rwmf-w63j-p7gv"]}
