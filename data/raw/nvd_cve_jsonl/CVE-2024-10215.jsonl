This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.","references":["https://documentation.iqonic.design/wpbookit/versions/change-log","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2d23a2b9-8476-4564-a5de-5e6cfc38ce68?source=cve"]}
