{"id":"CVE-2025-27616","publishedDate":"2025-03-10T19:15:41.080","cvssV3":8.5,"description":"Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. Prior to versions 0.25.3 and 0.26.3, by spoofing a webhook payload with a specific set of headers and body data, an attacker could transfer ownership of a repository and its repo level secrets to a separate repository. These secrets could be exfiltrated by follow up builds to the repository. Users with an enabled repository with access to repo level CI secrets in Vela are vulnerable to the exploit, and any user with access to the CI instance and the linked source control manager can perform the exploit. Versions 0.25.3 and 0.26.3 fix the issue. No known workarounds are available.","references":["https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/257886e5a3eea518548387885894e239668584f5","https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/67c1892e2464dc54b8d2588815dfb7819222500b","https://github.com/go-vela/server/releases/tag/v0.25.3","https://github.com/go-vela/server/releases/tag/v0.26.3","https://github.com/go-vela/server/security/advisories/GHSA-9m63-33q3-xq5x"]}
