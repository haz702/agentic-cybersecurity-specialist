{"id":"CVE-2020-14933","publishedDate":"2020-06-20T13:15:10.523","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"compose.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.22 calls unserialize for the $attachments value, which originates from an HTTP POST request. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because these two conditions for PHP object injection are not satisfied: existence of a PHP magic method (such as __wakeup or __destruct), and any attack-relevant classes must be declared before unserialize is called (or must be autoloaded).","references":["https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/20/1","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/20/1"]}
