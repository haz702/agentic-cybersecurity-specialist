{"id":"CVE-2024-11349","publishedDate":"2024-12-21T05:15:07.017","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them through the sb_login_user_with_otp_fun() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as arbitrary users, including administrators.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/adforest-classified-wordpress-theme/19481695","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f374b3d1-820b-473f-8d2b-c3267e6d23d9?source=cve"]}
