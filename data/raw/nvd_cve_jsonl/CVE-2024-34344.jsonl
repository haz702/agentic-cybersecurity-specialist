{"id":"CVE-2024-34344","publishedDate":"2024-08-05T21:15:38.457","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Nuxt is a free and open-source framework to create full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js. Due to the insufficient validation of the `path` parameter in the NuxtTestComponentWrapper, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on the server side, which allows them to execute arbitrary commands. Users who open a malicious web page in the browser while running the test locally are affected by this vulnerability, which results in the remote code execution from the malicious web page. Since web pages can send requests to arbitrary addresses, a malicious web page can repeatedly try to exploit this vulnerability, which then triggers the exploit when the test server starts.","references":["https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/security/advisories/GHSA-v784-fjjh-f8r4"]}
