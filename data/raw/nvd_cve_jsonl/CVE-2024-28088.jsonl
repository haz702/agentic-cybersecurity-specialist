{"id":"CVE-2024-28088","publishedDate":"2024-03-04T00:15:47.017","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"LangChain through 0.1.10 allows ../ directory traversal by an actor who is able to control the final part of the path parameter in a load_chain call. This bypasses the intended behavior of loading configurations only from the hwchase17/langchain-hub GitHub repository. The outcome can be disclosure of an API key for a large language model online service, or remote code execution. (A patch is available as of release 0.1.29 of langchain-core.)","references":["https://github.com/PinkDraconian/PoC-Langchain-RCE/blob/main/README.md","https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/f96dd57501131840b713ed7c2e86cbf1ddc2761f/libs/core/langchain_core/utils/loading.py","https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/18600","https://github.com/PinkDraconian/PoC-Langchain-RCE/blob/main/README.md","https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/f96dd57501131840b713ed7c2e86cbf1ddc2761f/libs/core/langchain_core/utils/loading.py","https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/18600"]}
