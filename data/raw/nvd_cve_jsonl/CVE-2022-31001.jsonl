{"id":"CVE-2022-31001","publishedDate":"2022-05-31T20:15:07.850","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-Agent library. Prior to version 1.13.8, an attacker can send a message with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, which may cause crash. This type of crash may be caused by `#define MATCH(s, m) (strncmp(s, m, n = sizeof(m) - 1) == 0)`, which will make `n` bigger and trigger out-of-bound access when `IS_NON_WS(s[n])`. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for this issue.","references":["https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/commit/a99804b336d0e16d26ab7119d56184d2d7110a36","https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-79jq-hh82-cv9g","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00001.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-18","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5410","https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/commit/a99804b336d0e16d26ab7119d56184d2d7110a36","https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-79jq-hh82-cv9g","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00001.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-18","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5410"]}
