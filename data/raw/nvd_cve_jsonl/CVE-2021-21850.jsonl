{"id":"CVE-2021-21850","publishedDate":"2021-08-25T19:15:09.320","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an integer overflow when the library encounters an atom using the \u201ctrun\u201d FOURCC code due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.","references":["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1297","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4966","https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1297","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4966"]}
