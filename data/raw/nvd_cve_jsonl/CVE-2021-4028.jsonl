{"id":"CVE-2021-4028","publishedDate":"2022-08-24T16:15:09.197","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"A flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA communications manager listener code allowed an attacker with local access to setup a socket to listen on a high port allowing for a list element to be used after free.
