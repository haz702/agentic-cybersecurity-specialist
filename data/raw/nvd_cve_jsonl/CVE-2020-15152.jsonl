{"id":"CVE-2020-15152","publishedDate":"2020-08-17T22:15:12.627","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"ftp-srv is an npm package which is a modern and extensible FTP server designed to be simple yet configurable. In ftp-srv before versions 2.19.6, 3.1.2, and 4.3.4 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery. The PORT command allows arbitrary IPs which can be used to cause the server to make a connection elsewhere. A possible workaround is blocking the PORT through the configuration. This issue is fixed in version2 2.19.6, 3.1.2, and 4.3.4. More information can be found on the linked advisory.","references":["https://github.com/autovance/ftp-srv/commit/e449e75219d918c400dec65b4b0759f60476abca","https://github.com/autovance/ftp-srv/security/advisories/GHSA-jw37-5gqr-cf9j","https://www.npmjs.com/package/ftp-srv","https://github.com/autovance/ftp-srv/commit/e449e75219d918c400dec65b4b0759f60476abca","https://github.com/autovance/ftp-srv/security/advisories/GHSA-jw37-5gqr-cf9j","https://www.npmjs.com/package/ftp-srv"]}
