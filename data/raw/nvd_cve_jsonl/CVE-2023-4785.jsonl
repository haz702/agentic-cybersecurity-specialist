Linux) allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by initiating a significant number of connections with the server. Note that gRPC C++ Python, and Ruby are affected, but gRPC Java, and Go are NOT affected.\u00a0","references":["https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33656","https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33667","https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33669","https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33670","https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33672","https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33656","https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33667","https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33669","https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33670","https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33672"]}
