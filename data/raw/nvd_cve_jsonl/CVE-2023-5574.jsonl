{"id":"CVE-2023-5574","publishedDate":"2023-10-25T20:15:18.717","cvssV3":7.0,"description":"A use-after-free flaw was found in xorg-x11-server-Xvfb. This issue occurs in Xvfb with a very specific and legacy configuration (a multi-screen setup with multiple protocol screens, also known as Zaphod mode). If the pointer is warped from a screen 1 to a screen 0, a use-after-free issue may be triggered during shutdown or reset of the Xvfb server, allowing for possible escalation of privileges or denial of service.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2298","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-5574","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2244735","https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2023-October/003430.html","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2298","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-5574","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2244735","https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2023-October/003430.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0004/"]}
