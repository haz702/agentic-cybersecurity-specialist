{"id":"CVE-2023-45138","publishedDate":"2023-10-12T17:15:09.900","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"Change Request is an pplication allowing users to request changes on a wiki without publishing the changes directly. Starting in version 0.11 and prior to version 1.9.2, it's possible for a user without any specific right to perform script injection and remote code execution just by inserting an appropriate title when creating a new Change Request. This vulnerability is particularly critical as Change Request aims at being created by user without any particular rights. The vulnerability has been fixed in Change Request 1.9.2. It's possible to workaround the issue without upgrading by editing the document `ChangeRequest.Code.ChangeRequestSheet` and by performing the same change as in the fix commit.","references":["https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/commit/7565e720117f73102f5a276239eabfe85e15cff4","https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/security/advisories/GHSA-f776-w9v2-7vfj","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CRAPP-298","https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/commit/7565e720117f73102f5a276239eabfe85e15cff4","https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/security/advisories/GHSA-f776-w9v2-7vfj","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CRAPP-298"]}
