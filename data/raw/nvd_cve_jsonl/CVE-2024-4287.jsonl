{"id":"CVE-2024-4287","publishedDate":"2024-05-20T13:15:23.980","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists due to improper input validation in the workspace update process. Specifically, the application fails to validate or format JSON data sent in an HTTP POST request to `/api/workspace/:workspace-slug/update`, allowing it to be executed as part of a database query without restrictions. This flaw enables users with a manager role to craft a request that includes nested write operations, effectively allowing them to create new Administrator accounts.","references":["https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/94b58249a37a21b1c08deaa2d1edfdecbb6deb18","https://huntr.com/bounties/34491fb7-5133-4e80-8782-74124350bbdb","https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/94b58249a37a21b1c08deaa2d1edfdecbb6deb18","https://huntr.com/bounties/34491fb7-5133-4e80-8782-74124350bbdb"]}
