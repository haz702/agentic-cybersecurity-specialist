{"id":"CVE-2020-24683","publishedDate":"2020-12-22T22:15:13.757","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The affected versions of S+ Operations (version 2.1 SP1 and earlier) used an approach for user authentication which relies on validation at the client node (client-side authentication). This is not as secure as having the server validate a client application before allowing a connection. Therefore, if the network communication or endpoints for these applications are not protected, unauthorized actors can bypass authentication and make unauthorized connections to the server application.","references":["https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=2PAA123980&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch","https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=2PAA123980&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch"]}
