{"id":"CVE-2020-14967","publishedDate":"2020-06-22T12:15:10.150","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"An issue was discovered in the jsrsasign package before 8.0.18 for Node.js. Its RSA PKCS1 v1.5 decryption implementation does not detect ciphertext modification by prepending '\\0' bytes to ciphertexts (it decrypts modified ciphertexts without error). An attacker might prepend these bytes with the goal of triggering memory corruption issues.","references":["https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/439","https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.17","https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.18","https://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200724-0001/","https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsrsasign","https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/439","https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.17","https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/releases/tag/8.0.18","https://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200724-0001/","https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsrsasign"]}
