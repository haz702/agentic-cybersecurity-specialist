{"id":"CVE-2021-1361","publishedDate":"2021-02-24T20:15:13.287","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"A vulnerability in the implementation of an internal file management service for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode that are running Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create, delete, or overwrite arbitrary files with root privileges on the device. This vulnerability exists because TCP port 9075 is incorrectly configured to listen and respond to external connection requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP packets to an IP address that is configured on a local interface on TCP port 9075. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create, delete, or overwrite arbitrary files, including sensitive files that are related to the device configuration. For example, the attacker could add a user account without the device administrator knowing.","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-3000-9000-fileaction-QtLzDRy2","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-3000-9000-fileaction-QtLzDRy2"]}
