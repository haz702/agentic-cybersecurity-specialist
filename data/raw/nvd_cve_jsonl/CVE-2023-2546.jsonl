{"id":"CVE-2023-2546","publishedDate":"2023-06-06T02:15:09.943","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The WP User Switch plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to incorrect authentication checking in the 'wpus_allow_user_to_admin_bar_menu' function with the 'wpus_who_switch' cookie value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.","references":["https://lana.codes/lanavdb/0cfdc5fa-d219-46bb-b8cc-693ac28a9e92/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-user-switch/trunk/inc/functions.php?rev=2237142#L33","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2921182/wp-user-switch/trunk/inc/functions.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e89d912d-fa7a-4fb1-8872-95fa861c21ca?source=cve","https://lana.codes/lanavdb/0cfdc5fa-d219-46bb-b8cc-693ac28a9e92/","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-user-switch/trunk/inc/functions.php?rev=2237142#L33","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2921182/wp-user-switch/trunk/inc/functions.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e89d912d-fa7a-4fb1-8872-95fa861c21ca?source=cve"]}
