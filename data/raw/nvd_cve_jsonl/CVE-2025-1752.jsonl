{"id":"CVE-2025-1752","publishedDate":"2025-05-10T14:15:32.523","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability has been identified in the KnowledgeBaseWebReader class of the run-llama/llama_index project, affecting version ~ latest(v0.12.15). The vulnerability arises due to inappropriate secure coding measures, specifically the lack of proper implementation of the max_depth parameter in the get_article_urls function. This allows an attacker to exhaust Python's recursion limit through repeated function calls, leading to resource consumption and ultimately crashing the Python process.","references":["https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/commit/3c65db2947271de3bd1927dc66a044da385de4da","https://huntr.com/bounties/cd7b9082-7d75-42e4-84f5-dbee23cbc467","https://huntr.com/bounties/cd7b9082-7d75-42e4-84f5-dbee23cbc467"]}
