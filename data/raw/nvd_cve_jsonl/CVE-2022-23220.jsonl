{"id":"CVE-2022-23220","publishedDate":"2022-01-21T16:15:08.193","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"USBView 2.1 before 2.2 allows some local users (e.g., ones logged in via SSH) to execute arbitrary code as root because certain Polkit settings (e.g., allow_any=yes) for pkexec disable the authentication requirement. Code execution can, for example, use the --gtk-module option. This affects Ubuntu, Debian, and Gentoo.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/22/1","https://github.com/gregkh/usbview/commit/bf374fa4e5b9a756789dfd88efa93806a395463b","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-15","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5052","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/21/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/22/1","https://github.com/gregkh/usbview/commit/bf374fa4e5b9a756789dfd88efa93806a395463b","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-15","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5052","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/21/1"]}
