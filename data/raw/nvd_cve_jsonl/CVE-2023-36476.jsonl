{"id":"CVE-2023-36476","publishedDate":"2023-06-29T01:15:51.267","cvssV3":7.9,"description":"calamares-nixos-extensions provides Calamares branding and modules for NixOS, a distribution of GNU/Linux. Users of calamares-nixos-extensions version 0.3.12 and prior who installed NixOS through the graphical calamares installer, with an unencrypted `/boot`, on either non-UEFI systems or with a LUKS partition different from `/` have their LUKS key file in `/boot` as a plaintext CPIO archive attached to their NixOS initrd. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of version 0.3.13 to backport to NixOS 22.11, 23.05, and unstable channels. Expert users who have a copy of their data may, as a workaround, re-encrypt the LUKS partition(s) themselves.","references":["https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww","https://github.com/osresearch/heads/issues/1348","https://github.com/vlinkz/calamares-nixos-extensions/commit/837ca4da5521a74d3b5ca6f7b88890a6713faa22","https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-3rvf-24q2-24ww","https://github.com/osresearch/heads/issues/1348","https://github.com/vlinkz/calamares-nixos-extensions/commit/837ca4da5521a74d3b5ca6f7b88890a6713faa22"]}
