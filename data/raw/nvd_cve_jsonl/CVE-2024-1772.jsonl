This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/play-ht/trunk/includes/class-ajax-handler.php#L138","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/83a595b7-379c-4202-abdd-d8ba4a30c6a4?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/play-ht/trunk/includes/class-ajax-handler.php#L138","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/83a595b7-379c-4202-abdd-d8ba4a30c6a4?source=cve"]}
