{"id":"CVE-2024-6310","publishedDate":"2024-07-09T08:15:11.733","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Advanced AJAX Page Loader plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 2.7.7. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'admin_init_AAPL' function and missing file type validation in the 'AAPL_options_validate' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/advanced-ajax-page-loader/tags/2.7.7/advanced-ajax-page-loader.php#L131","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/advanced-ajax-page-loader/tags/2.7.7/advanced-ajax-page-loader.php#L41","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ccc75dee-1cf8-4fda-b2a1-f5d68e6c7887?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/advanced-ajax-page-loader/tags/2.7.7/advanced-ajax-page-loader.php#L131","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/advanced-ajax-page-loader/tags/2.7.7/advanced-ajax-page-loader.php#L41","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ccc75dee-1cf8-4fda-b2a1-f5d68e6c7887?source=cve"]}
