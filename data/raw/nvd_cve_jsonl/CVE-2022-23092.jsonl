{"id":"CVE-2022-23092","publishedDate":"2024-02-15T06:15:45.190","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The implementation of lib9p's handling of RWALK messages was missing a bounds check needed when unpacking the message contents.  The missing check means that the receipt of a specially crafted message will cause lib9p to overwrite unrelated memory.\n\nThe bug can be triggered by a malicious bhyve guest kernel to overwrite memory in the bhyve(8) process.  This could potentially lead to user-mode code execution on the host, subject to bhyve's Capsicum sandbox.","references":["https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-22:12.lib9p.asc","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240415-0009/","https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-22:12.lib9p.asc","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240415-0009/"]}
