{"id":"CVE-2024-8998","publishedDate":"2025-03-20T10:15:45.707","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in lunary-ai/lunary version git f07a845. The server uses the regex /{.*?}/ to match user-controlled strings. In the default JavaScript regex engine, this regex can take polynomial time to match certain crafted user inputs. As a result, an attacker can cause the server to hang for an arbitrary amount of time by submitting a specially crafted payload. This issue is fixed in version 1.4.26.","references":["https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/f2bfa036caf2c48686474f4560a9c5abcf5f43b7","https://huntr.com/bounties/4dbd8648-1dca-4f95-b74f-978ef030e97e","https://huntr.com/bounties/4dbd8648-1dca-4f95-b74f-978ef030e97e"]}
