{"id":"CVE-2024-31442","publishedDate":"2024-04-08T16:15:07.990","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"Redon Hub is a Roblox Product Delivery Bot, also known as a Hub. In all hubs before version 1.0.2, all commands are capable of being ran by all users, including admin commands. This allows users to receive products for free and delete/create/update products/tags/etc. The only non-affected command is `/products admin clear` as this was already programmed for bot owners only. All users should upgrade to version 1.0.2 to receive a patch.","references":["https://github.com/Redon-Tech/Redon-Hub/commit/38cb7c08d4d890e8a1badadbd46f459f06e3cdcd","https://github.com/Redon-Tech/Redon-Hub/security/advisories/GHSA-3rx8-6453-7q26","https://github.com/Redon-Tech/Redon-Hub/commit/38cb7c08d4d890e8a1badadbd46f459f06e3cdcd","https://github.com/Redon-Tech/Redon-Hub/security/advisories/GHSA-3rx8-6453-7q26"]}
