{"id":"CVE-2022-31097","publishedDate":"2022-07-15T12:15:08.903","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Versions on the 8.x and 9.x branch prior to 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting via the Unified Alerting feature of Grafana. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privilege from editor to admin by tricking an authenticated admin to click on a link. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10 contain a patch. As a workaround, it is possible to disable alerting or use legacy alerting.","references":["https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-vw7q-p2qg-4m5f","https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-8-5-9/","https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-9-0-3/","https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/release-notes/release-notes-8-4-10/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220901-0010/","https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-vw7q-p2qg-4m5f","https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-8-5-9/","https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-9-0-3/","https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/next/release-notes/release-notes-8-4-10/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220901-0010/"]}
