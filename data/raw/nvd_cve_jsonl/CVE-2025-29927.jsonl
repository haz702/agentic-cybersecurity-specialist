{"id":"CVE-2025-29927","publishedDate":"2025-03-21T15:15:42.660","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.","references":["https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/52a078da3884efe6501613c7834a3d02a91676d2","https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/5fd3ae8f8542677c6294f32d18022731eab6fe48","https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.3.5","https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v13.5.9","https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/23/3","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/23/4","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250328-0002/"]}
