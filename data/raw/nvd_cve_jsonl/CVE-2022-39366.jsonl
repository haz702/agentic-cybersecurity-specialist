{"id":"CVE-2022-39366","publishedDate":"2022-10-28T17:15:23.590","cvssV3":9.9,"description":"DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45, the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the `StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse` method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds.","references":["https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-missing-jwt-signature-check/","https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/blob/aa146db611e3a4ca3aa17bb740783f789d4444d3/metadata-service/auth-impl/src/main/java/com/datahub/authentication/token/StatelessTokenService.java#L134","https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/blob/aa146db611e3a4ca3aa17bb740783f789d4444d3/metadata-service/auth-impl/src/main/java/com/datahub/authentication/token/StatelessTokenService.java#L30","https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/releases/tag/v0.8.45","https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-r8gm-v65f-c973","https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-missing-jwt-signature-check/","https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/blob/aa146db611e3a4ca3aa17bb740783f789d4444d3/metadata-service/auth-impl/src/main/java/com/datahub/authentication/token/StatelessTokenService.java#L134","https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/blob/aa146db611e3a4ca3aa17bb740783f789d4444d3/metadata-service/auth-impl/src/main/java/com/datahub/authentication/token/StatelessTokenService.java#L30","https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/releases/tag/v0.8.45","https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-r8gm-v65f-c973"]}
