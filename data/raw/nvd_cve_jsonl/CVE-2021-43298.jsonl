{"id":"CVE-2021-43298","publishedDate":"2022-01-25T20:15:08.510","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The code that performs password matching when using 'Basic' HTTP authentication does not use a constant-time memcmp and has no rate-limiting. This means that an unauthenticated network attacker can brute-force the HTTP basic password, byte-by-byte, by recording the webserver's response time until the unauthorized (401) response.","references":["https://github.com/embedthis/goahead/issues/304","https://github.com/embedthis/goahead/issues/304"]}
