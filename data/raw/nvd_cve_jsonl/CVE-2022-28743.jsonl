{"id":"CVE-2022-28743","publishedDate":"2022-04-21T19:15:09.000","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulerability in Foscam R2C IP camera running System FW <= 1.13.1.6, and Application FW <= 2.91.2.66, allows an authenticated remote attacker with administrator permissions to execute arbitrary remote code via a malicious firmware patch. The impact of this vulnerability is that the remote attacker could gain full remote access to the IP camera and the underlying Linux system with root permissions. With root access to the camera's Linux OS, an attacker could effectively change the code that is running, add backdoor access, or invade the privacy of the user by accessing the live camera stream.","references":["https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/keeping-a-critical-eye-on-iot-devices.html","https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/threat-labs/keeping-a-critical-eye-on-iot-devices.html"]}
