{"id":"CVE-2024-9624","publishedDate":"2024-12-17T06:15:21.173","cvssV3":7.6,"description":"The WP All Import Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.3 due to missing SSRF protection on the pmxi_curl_download function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. On cloud platforms, it might allow attackers to read the Instance metadata.","references":["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eabde2e7-5cd4-4c3e-959a-69e04f6350d3?source=cve","https://www.wpallimport.com"]}
