{"id":"CVE-2024-47078","publishedDate":"2024-09-25T16:15:10.907","cvssV3":8.1,"description":"Meshtastic is an open source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network. Meshtastic uses MQTT to communicate over an internet connection to a shared or private MQTT Server. Nodes can communicate directly via an internet connection or proxied through a connected phone (i.e., via bluetooth). Prior to version 2.5.1, multiple weaknesses in the MQTT implementation allow for authentication and authorization bypasses resulting in unauthorized control of MQTT-connected nodes. Version 2.5.1 contains a patch.","references":["https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/security/advisories/GHSA-vqcq-wjwx-7252"]}
