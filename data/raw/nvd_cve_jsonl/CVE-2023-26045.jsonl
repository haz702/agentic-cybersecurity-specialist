{"id":"CVE-2023-26045","publishedDate":"2023-07-24T22:15:10.033","cvssV3":10.0,"description":"NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the exploit.","references":["https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/ec58700f6dff8e5b4af1544f6205ec362b593092","https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-vh2g-6c4x-5hmp","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230831-0004/","https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/commit/ec58700f6dff8e5b4af1544f6205ec362b593092","https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/security/advisories/GHSA-vh2g-6c4x-5hmp","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230831-0004/"]}
