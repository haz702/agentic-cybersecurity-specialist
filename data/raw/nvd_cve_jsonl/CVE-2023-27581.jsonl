{"id":"CVE-2023-27581","publishedDate":"2023-03-13T21:15:14.037","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"github-slug-action is a GitHub Action to expose slug value of GitHub environment variables inside of one's GitHub workflow. Starting in version 4.0.0` and prior to version 4.4.1, this action uses the `github.head_ref` parameter in an insecure way. This vulnerability can be triggered by any user on GitHub on any workflow using the action on pull requests. They just need to create a pull request with a branch name, which can contain the attack payload. This can be used to execute code on the GitHub runners and to exfiltrate any secrets one uses in the CI pipeline. A patched action is available in version 4.4.1. No workaround is available.","references":["https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/commit/102b1a064a9b145e56556e22b18b19c624538d94","https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/releases/tag/v4.4.1","https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/security/advisories/GHSA-6q4m-7476-932w","https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/","https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/commit/102b1a064a9b145e56556e22b18b19c624538d94","https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/releases/tag/v4.4.1","https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/security/advisories/GHSA-6q4m-7476-932w","https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/"]}
