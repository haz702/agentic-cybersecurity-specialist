{"id":"CVE-2024-7568","publishedDate":"2024-08-24T02:15:04.490","cvssV3":9.6,"description":"The Favicon Generator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the output_sub_admin_page_0 function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The plugin author deleted the functionality of the plugin to patch this issue and close the plugin, we recommend seeking an alternative to this plugin.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3139340%40favicon-generator&new=3139340%40favicon-generator&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6eb3ad80-3510-4018-91af-b733ef62e28f?source=cve"]}
