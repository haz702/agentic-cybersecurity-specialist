{"id":"CVE-2024-2952","publishedDate":"2024-04-10T17:15:54.823","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"BerriAI/litellm is vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via the `/completions` endpoint. The vulnerability arises from the `hf_chat_template` method processing the `chat_template` parameter from the `tokenizer_config.json` file through the Jinja template engine without proper sanitization. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious `tokenizer_config.json` files that execute arbitrary code on the server.","references":["https://github.com/berriai/litellm/commit/8a1cdc901708b07b7ff4eca20f9cb0f1f0e8d0b3","https://huntr.com/bounties/a9e0a164-6de0-43a4-a640-0cbfb54220a4","https://github.com/berriai/litellm/commit/8a1cdc901708b07b7ff4eca20f9cb0f1f0e8d0b3","https://huntr.com/bounties/a9e0a164-6de0-43a4-a640-0cbfb54220a4"]}
