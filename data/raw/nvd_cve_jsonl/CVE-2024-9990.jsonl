{"id":"CVE-2024-9990","publishedDate":"2024-10-29T17:15:05.707","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Crypto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.15. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'crypto_connect_ajax_process::check' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/crypto/tags/2.10/includes/class-crypto_connect_ajax_register.php#L31","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/crypto/tags/2.10/includes/class-crypto_connect_ajax_register.php#L65","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/cea39157-94aa-4982-983e-9c3e4b1af86d?source=cve"]}
