{"id":"CVE-2024-9061","publishedDate":"2024-10-16T08:15:07.323","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"The The WP Popup Builder \u2013 Popup Forms and Marketing Lead Generation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via the wp_ajax_nopriv_shortcode_Api_Add AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.3.5 with a nonce check, which effectively prevented access to the affected function. However, version 1.3.6 incorporates the correct authorization check to prevent unauthorized access.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3166506/wp-popup-builder","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0cac1dc0-87dc-43eb-9db1-638a91200b43?source=cve"]}
