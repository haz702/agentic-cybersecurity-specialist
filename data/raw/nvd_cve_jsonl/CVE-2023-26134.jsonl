{"id":"CVE-2023-26134","publishedDate":"2023-06-28T05:15:10.467","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Versions of the package git-commit-info before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection such that the package-exported method gitCommitInfo () fails to sanitize its parameter commit, which later flows into a sensitive command execution API. As a result, attackers may inject malicious commands once they control the hash content.","references":["https://github.com/JPeer264/node-git-commit-info/commit/f7c491ede51f886a988af9b266797cb24591d18c","https://github.com/JPeer264/node-git-commit-info/issues/24","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITCOMMITINFO-5740174","https://github.com/JPeer264/node-git-commit-info/commit/f7c491ede51f886a988af9b266797cb24591d18c","https://github.com/JPeer264/node-git-commit-info/issues/24","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GITCOMMITINFO-5740174"]}
