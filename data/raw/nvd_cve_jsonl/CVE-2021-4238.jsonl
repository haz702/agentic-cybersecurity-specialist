{"id":"CVE-2021-4238","publishedDate":"2022-12-27T22:15:12.073","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"Randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected. The RandomAlphaNumeric and CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric functions always return strings containing at least one digit from 0 to 9. This significantly reduces the amount of entropy in short strings generated by these functions.","references":["https://github.com/Masterminds/goutils/commit/869801f20f9f1e7ecdbdb6422049d8241270d5e1","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0411","https://github.com/Masterminds/goutils/commit/869801f20f9f1e7ecdbdb6422049d8241270d5e1","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0411"]}
