{"id":"CVE-2023-38408","publishedDate":"2023-07-20T03:15:10.170","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173661/OpenSSH-Forwarded-SSH-Agent-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/20/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/20/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/11","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/9","https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2023/07/19/cve-2023-38408-remote-code-execution-in-opensshs-forwarded-ssh-agent","https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/7bc29a9d5cd697290aa056e94ecee6253d3425f8","https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/f03a4faa55c4ce0818324701dadbf91988d7351d","https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/f8f5a6b003981bb824329dc987d101977beda7ca","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00021.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CEBTJJINE2I3FHAUKKNQWMFGYMLSMWKQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RAXVQS6ZYTULFAK3TEJHRLKZALJS3AOU/","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36790196","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202307-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230803-0010/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213940","https://www.openssh.com/security.html","https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.3p2","https://www.qualys.com/2023/07/19/cve-2023-38408/rce-openssh-forwarded-ssh-agent.txt","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/exploring-opensshs-agent-forwarding-rce-cve-2023-38408","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173661/OpenSSH-Forwarded-SSH-Agent-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/20/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/20/2","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/11","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/22/9","https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2023/07/19/cve-2023-38408-remote-code-execution-in-opensshs-forwarded-ssh-agent","https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/7bc29a9d5cd697290aa056e94ecee6253d3425f8","https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/f03a4faa55c4ce0818324701dadbf91988d7351d","https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/f8f5a6b003981bb824329dc987d101977beda7ca","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00021.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CEBTJJINE2I3FHAUKKNQWMFGYMLSMWKQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RAXVQS6ZYTULFAK3TEJHRLKZALJS3AOU/","https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36790196","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202307-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230803-0010/","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213940","https://www.openssh.com/security.html","https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.3p2","https://www.qualys.com/2023/07/19/cve-2023-38408/rce-openssh-forwarded-ssh-agent.txt","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/exploring-opensshs-agent-forwarding-rce-cve-2023-38408"]}
