This is due to missing validation on the user being supplied in the 'crypto_connect_ajax_process::register' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/crypto/tags/2.10/includes/class-crypto_connect_ajax_register.php#L91","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7bfe87cf-9883-4f8f-a0f5-23bbc7bb9b7c?source=cve"]}
