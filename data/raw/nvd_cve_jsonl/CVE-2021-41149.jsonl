{"id":"CVE-2021-41149","publishedDate":"2021-10-19T18:15:08.093","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"Tough provides a set of Rust libraries and tools for using and generating the update framework (TUF) repositories. The tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does not properly sanitize target names when caching a repository, or when saving specific targets to an output directory. When targets are cached or saved, files could be overwritten with arbitrary content anywhere on the system. A fix is available in version 0.12.0. No workarounds to this issue are known.","references":["https://github.com/awslabs/tough/commit/1809b9bd1106d78a51fbea3071aa97a3530bac9a","https://github.com/awslabs/tough/security/advisories/GHSA-x3r5-q6mj-m485","https://github.com/awslabs/tough/commit/1809b9bd1106d78a51fbea3071aa97a3530bac9a","https://github.com/awslabs/tough/security/advisories/GHSA-x3r5-q6mj-m485"]}
