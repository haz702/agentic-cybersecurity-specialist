{"id":"CVE-2022-26495","publishedDate":"2022-03-06T06:15:07.303","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"In nbd-server in nbd before 3.24, there is an integer overflow with a resultant heap-based buffer overflow. A value of 0xffffffff in the name length field will cause a zero-sized buffer to be allocated for the name, resulting in a write to a dangling pointer. This issue exists for the NBD_OPT_INFO, NBD_OPT_GO, and NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME messages.","references":["https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00014.html","https://lists.debian.org/nbd/2022/01/msg00037.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G2UPX62BIWOOHSACGUDB7E3O4URNN37F/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IZHR73XMAJTCFGKUZRXVTZKCK2X3IFNA/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PU5JFD4PEJED72TZLZ5R2Q2SFXICU5I5/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-10","https://sourceforge.net/projects/nbd/files/nbd/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5100","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00014.html","https://lists.debian.org/nbd/2022/01/msg00037.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G2UPX62BIWOOHSACGUDB7E3O4URNN37F/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IZHR73XMAJTCFGKUZRXVTZKCK2X3IFNA/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PU5JFD4PEJED72TZLZ5R2Q2SFXICU5I5/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-10","https://sourceforge.net/projects/nbd/files/nbd/","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5100"]}
