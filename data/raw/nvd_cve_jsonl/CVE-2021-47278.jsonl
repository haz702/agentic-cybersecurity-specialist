{"id":"CVE-2021-47278","publishedDate":"2024-05-21T15:15:16.143","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: mhi: pci_generic: Fix possible use-after-free in mhi_pci_remove()\n\nThis driver's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function\ndoes not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the\ntimer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function\nhas finished, which would result in a use-after-free.\n\nFix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler\nhas finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0b67808ade8893a1b3608ddd74fac7854786c919","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c597d5c59c7a6417dba06590f59b922e01188e8d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0b67808ade8893a1b3608ddd74fac7854786c919","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c597d5c59c7a6417dba06590f59b922e01188e8d"]}
