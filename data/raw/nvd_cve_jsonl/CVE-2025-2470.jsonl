{"id":"CVE-2025-2470","publishedDate":"2025-04-25T12:15:16.903","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The Service Finder Bookings plugin for WordPress, used by the Service Finder - Directory and Job Board WordPress Theme, is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 5.1. This is due to a lack of restriction on user role in the 'nsl_registration_store_extra_input' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register an account on the site with an arbitrary role, including Administrator, when registering via a social login. The Nextend Social Login plugin must be installed and configured to exploit the vulnerability.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/service-finder-service-and-business-listing-wordpress-theme/15208793","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a1f62cda-262b-46d9-a839-0a573813cfa1?source=cve"]}
