{"id":"CVE-2023-38877","publishedDate":"2023-09-28T04:15:12.280","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"A host header injection vulnerability exists in gugoan's Economizzer v.0.9-beta1 and commit 3730880 (April 2023). By sending a specially crafted host header in the reset password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This allows an attacker to reset other users' passwords.","references":["https://github.com/dub-flow/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2023-38877","https://github.com/gugoan/economizzer/","https://www.economizzer.org","https://github.com/dub-flow/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2023-38877","https://github.com/gugoan/economizzer/","https://www.economizzer.org"]}
