{"id":"CVE-2024-29027","publishedDate":"2024-03-19T19:15:06.980","cvssV3":9.0,"description":"Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection, internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server.","references":["https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/5ae6d6a36d75c4511029f0ba5673ae4b2999179b","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/9f6e3429d3b326cf4e2994733c618d08032fac6e","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/6.5.5","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/7.0.0-alpha.29","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-6hh7-46r2-vf29","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/5ae6d6a36d75c4511029f0ba5673ae4b2999179b","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/9f6e3429d3b326cf4e2994733c618d08032fac6e","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/6.5.5","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/7.0.0-alpha.29","https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-6hh7-46r2-vf29"]}
