{"id":"CVE-2022-49478","publishedDate":"2025-02-26T07:01:24.050","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: pvrusb2: fix array-index-out-of-bounds in pvr2_i2c_core_init\n\nSyzbot reported that -1 is used as array index. The problem was in\nmissing validation check.\n\nhdw->unit_number is initialized with -1 and then if init table walk fails\nthis value remains unchanged. Since code blindly uses this member for\narray indexing adding sanity check is the easiest fix for that.\n\nhdw->workpoll initialization moved upper to prevent warning in\n__flush_work.","references":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1310fc3538dcc375a2f46ef0a438512c2ca32827","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/24e807541e4a9263ed928e6ae3498de3ad43bd1e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2e004fe914b243db41fa96f9e583385f360ea58e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3309c2c574e13b21b44729f5bdbf21f60189b79a","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4351bfe36aba9fa7dc9d68d498d25d41a0f45e67","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/471bec68457aaf981add77b4f590d65dd7da1059","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3304766d9384886e6d3092c776273526947a2e9","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3660e06675bccec4bf149c7229ea1d491ba10d7","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f99a8b1ec0eddc2931aeaa4f490277a15b39f511"]}
