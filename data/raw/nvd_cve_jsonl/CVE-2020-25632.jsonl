{"id":"CVE-2020-25632","publishedDate":"2021-03-03T17:15:11.660","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1879577","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZWZ36QK4IKU6MWDWNOOWKPH3WXZBHT2R/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202104-05","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220325-0001/","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1879577","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZWZ36QK4IKU6MWDWNOOWKPH3WXZBHT2R/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202104-05","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220325-0001/"]}
