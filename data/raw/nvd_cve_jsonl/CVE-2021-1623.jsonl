This vulnerability is due to the punt path being overwhelmed by large quantities of SNMP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of SNMP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overload the device punt path, resulting in a DoS condition.","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cbr8snmp-zGjkZ9Fc","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cbr8snmp-zGjkZ9Fc"]}
