{"id":"CVE-2024-13553","publishedDate":"2025-04-01T12:15:14.643","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"The SMS Alert Order Notifications \u2013 WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.9. This is due to the plugin using the Host header to determine if the plugin is in a playground environment. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to spoof the Host header to make the OTP code \"1234\" and authenticate as any user, including administrators.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3227241%40sms-alert&new=3227241%40sms-alert&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3248017%40sms-alert&new=3248017%40sms-alert&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4e444a30-11c5-4219-b4fe-635084cbac3a?source=cve"]}
