{"id":"CVE-2021-44504","publishedDate":"2022-04-15T18:15:09.270","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"An issue was discovered in FIS GT.M through V7.0-000 (related to the YottaDB code base). Using crafted input, an attacker can cause a size variable, stored as an signed int, to equal an extremely large value, which is interpreted as a negative value during a check. This value is then used in a memcpy call on the stack, causing a memory segmentation fault.","references":["http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-002_Release_Notes.html","https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/828","https://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/","http://tinco.pair.com/bhaskar/gtm/doc/articles/GTM_V7.0-002_Release_Notes.html","https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB/-/issues/828","https://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/"]}
