{"id":"CVE-2024-7730","publishedDate":"2024-11-14T12:15:18.857","cvssV3":7.4,"description":"A heap buffer overflow was found in the virtio-snd device in QEMU. When reading input audio in the virtio-snd input callback, virtio_snd_pcm_in_cb, the function did not check whether the iov can fit the data buffer. This issue can trigger an out-of-bounds write if the size of the virtio queue element is equal to virtio_snd_pcm_status, which makes the available space for audio data zero.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7730","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2304289"]}
