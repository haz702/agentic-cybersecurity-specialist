{"id":"CVE-2015-20001","publishedDate":"2021-04-11T20:15:12.237","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"In the standard library in Rust before 1.2.0, BinaryHeap is not panic-safe. The binary heap is left in an inconsistent state when the comparison of generic elements inside sift_up or sift_down_range panics. This bug leads to a drop of zeroed memory as an arbitrary type, which can result in a memory safety violation.","references":["https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25842","https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25856","https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/25842","https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/25856"]}
