{"id":"CVE-2023-4408","publishedDate":"2024-02-13T14:15:45.253","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The DNS message parsing code in `named` includes a section whose computational complexity is overly high. It does not cause problems for typical DNS traffic, but crafted queries and responses may cause excessive CPU load on the affected `named` instance by exploiting this flaw. This issue affects both authoritative servers and recursive resolvers.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.0.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/13/1","https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-4408","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVRDSJVZKMCXKKPP6PNR62T7RWZ3YSDZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PNNHZSZPG2E7NBMBNYPGHCFI4V4XRWNQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RGS7JN6FZXUSTC2XKQHH27574XOULYYJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZDZFMEKQTZ4L7RY46FCENWFB5MDT263R/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0001/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/13/1","https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2023-4408","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVRDSJVZKMCXKKPP6PNR62T7RWZ3YSDZ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PNNHZSZPG2E7NBMBNYPGHCFI4V4XRWNQ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RGS7JN6FZXUSTC2XKQHH27574XOULYYJ/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZDZFMEKQTZ4L7RY46FCENWFB5MDT263R/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0001/"]}
