{"id":"CVE-2024-30249","publishedDate":"2024-04-04T19:15:08.293","cvssV3":8.6,"description":"Cloudburst Network provides network components used within Cloudburst projects. A vulnerability in versions prior to `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` impacts publicly accessible software depending on the affected versions of Network and allows an attacker to use Network as an amplification vector for a UDP denial of service attack against a third party or as an attempt to trigger service suspension of the host. All consumers of the library should upgrade to at least version `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` to receive a fix. There are no known workarounds beyond updating the library.","references":["https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Network/security/advisories/GHSA-6h3m-c6fv-8hvh","https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Network/security/advisories/GHSA-6h3m-c6fv-8hvh"]}
