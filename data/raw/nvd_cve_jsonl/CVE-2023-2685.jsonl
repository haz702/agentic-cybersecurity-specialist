{"id":"CVE-2023-2685","publishedDate":"2023-07-28T12:15:09.750","cvssV3":7.2,"description":"A vulnerability was found in AO-OPC server versions mentioned above. As the directory information for the service entry is not enclosed in quotation marks, potential attackers could possibly call up another application than the AO-OPC server by starting the service. The service might be started with system user privileges which could cause a shift in user access privileges.\n\nIt is unlikely to exploit the vulnerability in well maintained Windows installations since the attacker would need write access to system folders.\n\nAn update is available that resolves the vulnerability found during an internal review in the product AO-OPC = 3.2.1\u00a0\n","references":["https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK108468A4093&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch","https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK108468A4093&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch"]}
