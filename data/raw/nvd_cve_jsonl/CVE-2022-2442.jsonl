This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrative privileges to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/trunk/includes/staging/class-wpvivid-staging.php?rev=2749419#L1747","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/trunk/includes/staging/class-wpvivid-staging.php?rev=2749419#L1783","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2766112%40wpvivid-backuprestore%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2Fstaging%2Fclass-wpvivid-staging.php&new=2766112%40wpvivid-backuprestore%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2Fstaging%2Fclass-wpvivid-staging.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b7e2ca2e-c495-47f8-9c18-da5ba73d9e70?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2442","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/trunk/includes/staging/class-wpvivid-staging.php?rev=2749419#L1747","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpvivid-backuprestore/trunk/includes/staging/class-wpvivid-staging.php?rev=2749419#L1783","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2766112%40wpvivid-backuprestore%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2Fstaging%2Fclass-wpvivid-staging.php&new=2766112%40wpvivid-backuprestore%2Ftrunk%2Fincludes%2Fstaging%2Fclass-wpvivid-staging.php","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b7e2ca2e-c495-47f8-9c18-da5ba73d9e70?source=cve","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2442"]}
