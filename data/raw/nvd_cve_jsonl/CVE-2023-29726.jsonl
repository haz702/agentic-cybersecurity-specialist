{"id":"CVE-2023-29726","publishedDate":"2023-05-30T23:15:09.513","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"The Call Blocker application 6.6.3 for Android incorrectly opens a key component that an attacker can use to inject large amounts of dirty data into the application's database. When the application starts, it loads the data from the database into memory. Once the attacker injects too much data, the application triggers an OOM error and crashes, resulting in a persistent denial of service.","references":["https://github.com/LianKee/SO-CVEs/blob/main/CVEs/CVE-2023-29726/CVE%20detail.md","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cuiet.blockCalls","https://www.call-blocker.info/","https://github.com/LianKee/SO-CVEs/blob/main/CVEs/CVE-2023-29726/CVE%20detail.md","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cuiet.blockCalls","https://www.call-blocker.info/"]}
