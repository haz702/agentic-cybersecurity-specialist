{"id":"CVE-2024-31080","publishedDate":"2024-04-04T14:15:10.330","cvssV3":7.3,"description":"A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcXIGetSelectedEvents() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.","references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1785","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2036","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2037","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2038","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2039","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2040","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2041","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2042","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2080","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2616","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3258","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3261","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3343","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9093","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9122","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-31080","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2271997","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/13","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/10","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1785","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2036","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2037","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2038","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2039","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2040","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2041","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2042","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2080","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2616","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3258","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3261","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3343","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-31080","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2271997","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00009.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6TF7FZXOKHIKPZXYIMSQXKVH7WITKV3V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EBLQJIAXEDMEGRGZMSH7CWUJHSVKUWLV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/P73U4DAAWLFZAPD75GLXTGMSTTQWW5AP/"]}
