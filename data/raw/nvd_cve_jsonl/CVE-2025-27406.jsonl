{"id":"CVE-2025-27406","publishedDate":"2025-03-26T16:15:23.147","cvssV3":7.6,"description":"Icinga Reporting is the central component for reporting related functionality in the monitoring web frontend and framework Icinga Web 2. A vulnerability present in versions 0.10.0 through 1.0.2 allows to set up a template that allows to embed arbitrary Javascript. This enables the attacker to act on behalf of the user, if the template is being previewed; and act on behalf of the headless browser, if a report using the template is printed to PDF. This issue has been resolved in version 1.0.3 of Icinga Reporting. As a workaround, review all templates and remove suspicious settings.","references":["https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting/releases/tag/v1.0.3","https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting/security/advisories/GHSA-7qvq-54vm-r7hx"]}
