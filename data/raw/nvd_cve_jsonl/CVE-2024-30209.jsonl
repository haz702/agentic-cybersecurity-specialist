{"id":"CVE-2024-30209","publishedDate":"2024-05-14T16:16:49.580","cvssV3":9.6,"description":"A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA00) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA10) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA20) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-0DA30) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA10) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA20) (All versions < V3.0.1.1), SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager (6GT2780-1EA30) (All versions < V3.0.1.1). Affected systems transmit client-side resources without proper cryptographic protection. This could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on and modify resources in transit. A successful exploit requires an attacker to be in the network path between the RTLS Locating Manager server and a client (MitM).","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-093430.html","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-093430.html"]}
