{"id":"CVE-2022-48622","publishedDate":"2024-01-26T09:15:07.570","cvssV3":7.8,"description":"In GNOME GdkPixbuf (aka gdk-pixbuf) through 2.42.10, the ANI (Windows animated cursor) decoder encounters heap memory corruption (in ani_load_chunk in io-ani.c) when parsing chunks in a crafted .ani file. A crafted file could allow an attacker to overwrite heap metadata, leading to a denial of service or code execution attack. This occurs in gdk_pixbuf_set_option() in gdk-pixbuf.c.","references":["https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdk-pixbuf/-/issues/202","https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdk-pixbuf/-/issues/202"]}
