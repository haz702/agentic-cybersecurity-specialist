{"id":"CVE-2024-22421","publishedDate":"2024-01-19T21:15:09.870","cvssV3":7.6,"description":"JupyterLab is an extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the Jupyter Notebook and Architecture. Users of JupyterLab who click on a malicious link may get their `Authorization` and `XSRFToken` tokens exposed to a third party when running an older `jupyter-server` version. JupyterLab versions 4.1.0b2, 4.0.11, and 3.6.7 are patched. No workaround has been identified, however users should ensure to upgrade `jupyter-server` to version 2.7.2 or newer which includes a redirect vulnerability fix.","references":["https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/commit/19bd9b96cb2e77170a67e43121637d0b5619e8c6","https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/security/advisories/GHSA-44cc-43rp-5947","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UQJKNRDRFMKGVRIYNNN6CKMNJDNYWO2H/","https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/commit/19bd9b96cb2e77170a67e43121637d0b5619e8c6","https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/security/advisories/GHSA-44cc-43rp-5947","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UQJKNRDRFMKGVRIYNNN6CKMNJDNYWO2H/"]}
