{"id":"CVE-2024-1483","publishedDate":"2024-04-16T00:15:08.353","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.9.2, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the server. By crafting a series of HTTP POST requests with specially crafted 'artifact_location' and 'source' parameters, using a local URI with '#' instead of '?', an attacker can traverse the server's directory structure. The issue occurs due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the server's handlers.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/52a3855d-93ff-4460-ac24-9c7e4334198d","https://huntr.com/bounties/52a3855d-93ff-4460-ac24-9c7e4334198d"]}
