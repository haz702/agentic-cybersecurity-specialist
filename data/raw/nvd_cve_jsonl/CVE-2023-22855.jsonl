{"id":"CVE-2023-22855","publishedDate":"2023-02-15T21:15:10.847","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Kardex Mlog MCC 5.7.12+0-a203c2a213-master allows remote code execution. It spawns a web interface listening on port 8088. A user-controllable path is handed to a path-concatenation method (Path.Combine from .NET) without proper sanitisation. This yields the possibility of including local files, as well as remote files on SMB shares. If one provides a file with the extension .t4, it is rendered with the .NET templating engine mono/t4, which can execute code.","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171046/Kardex-Mlog-MCC-5.7.12-0-a203c2a213-master-File-Inclusion-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171689/Kardex-Mlog-MCC-5.7.12-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Feb/10","https://github.com/patrickhener/CVE-2023-22855/blob/main/advisory/advisory.md","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51239","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171046/Kardex-Mlog-MCC-5.7.12-0-a203c2a213-master-File-Inclusion-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171689/Kardex-Mlog-MCC-5.7.12-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Feb/10","https://github.com/patrickhener/CVE-2023-22855/blob/main/advisory/advisory.md","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51239"]}
