{"id":"CVE-2022-2336","publishedDate":"2022-08-17T21:15:09.137","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"Softing Secure Integration Server, edgeConnector, and edgeAggregator software ships with the default administrator credentials as `admin` and password as `admin`. This allows Softing to log in to the server directly to perform administrative functions. Upon installation or upon first login, the application does not ask the user to change the `admin` password. There is no warning or prompt to ask the user to change the default password, and to change the password, many steps are required.","references":["https://industrial.softing.com/fileadmin/psirt/downloads/syt-2022-6.html","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-228-04","https://industrial.softing.com/fileadmin/psirt/downloads/syt-2022-6.html","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-228-04"]}
