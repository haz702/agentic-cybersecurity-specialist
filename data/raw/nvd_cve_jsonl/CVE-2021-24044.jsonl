{"id":"CVE-2021-24044","publishedDate":"2022-01-15T01:15:07.943","cvssV3":9.8,"description":"By passing invalid javascript code where await and yield were called upon non-async and non-generator getter/setter functions, Hermes would invoke generator functions and error out on invalid await/yield positions. This could result in segmentation fault as a consequence of type confusion error, with a low chance of RCE. This issue affects Hermes versions prior to v0.10.0.","references":["https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2021-24044","https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2021-24044"]}
