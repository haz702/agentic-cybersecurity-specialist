{"id":"CVE-2023-1888","publishedDate":"2023-06-09T06:15:58.410","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The Directorist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an arbitrary user password reset in versions up to, and including, 7.5.4. This is due to a lack of validation checks within login.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to reset the password of an arbitrary user and gain elevated (e.g., administrator) privileges.","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2920100/directorist","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/01943559-e05b-4dca-b322-d880b2729ee7?source=cve","https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2920100/directorist","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/01943559-e05b-4dca-b322-d880b2729ee7?source=cve"]}
