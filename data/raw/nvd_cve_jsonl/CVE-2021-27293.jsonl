{"id":"CVE-2021-27293","publishedDate":"2021-07-12T11:15:08.100","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"RestSharp < 106.11.8-alpha.0.13 uses a regular expression which is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) when converting strings into DateTimes. If a server responds with a malicious string, the client using RestSharp will be stuck processing it for an exceedingly long time. Thus the remote server can trigger Denial of Service.","references":["https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/issues/1556","https://restsharp.dev/","https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp/issues/1556","https://restsharp.dev/"]}
