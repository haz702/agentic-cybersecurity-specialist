{"id":"CVE-2022-45152","publishedDate":"2022-11-25T19:15:12.107","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"A blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was found in Moodle. This flaw exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in LTI provider library. The library does not utilise Moodle's inbuilt cURL helper, which resulted in a blind SSRF risk. An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request and trick the application to initiate requests to arbitrary systems. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform SSRF attacks.","references":["http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=MDL-71920","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2142775","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2DHYIIAUXUBHMBEDYU7TYNZXEN2W2SA2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74SXNGA5RIWM7QNX7H3G7SYIQLP4UUGV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NLRJB5JNKK3VVBLV3NH3RI7COEDAXSAB/","https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=440772","http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=MDL-71920","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2142775","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2DHYIIAUXUBHMBEDYU7TYNZXEN2W2SA2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74SXNGA5RIWM7QNX7H3G7SYIQLP4UUGV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NLRJB5JNKK3VVBLV3NH3RI7COEDAXSAB/","https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=440772"]}
