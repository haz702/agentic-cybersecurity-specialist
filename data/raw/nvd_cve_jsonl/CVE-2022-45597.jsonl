NOTE: the vendor does not consider this a vulnerability because the report is only about use of certificates at the application layer (not the transport layer) and \"Certificates are exchanged in a controlled fashion between entities within a trust relationship. This is why self-signed certificates may be used and why validating certificates isn\u2019t as important as doing so for the transport layer certificates.\"","references":["http://componentspace.com","http://componentspacesaml2.com","https://www.componentspace.com/documentation/saml-for-asp-net-core/ComponentSpace%20SAML%20for%20ASP.NET%20Core%20Release%20Notes.pdf","http://componentspace.com","http://componentspacesaml2.com","https://www.componentspace.com/documentation/saml-for-asp-net-core/ComponentSpace%20SAML%20for%20ASP.NET%20Core%20Release%20Notes.pdf"]}
