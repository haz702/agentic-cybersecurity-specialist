{"id":"CVE-2024-23841","publishedDate":"2024-01-30T18:15:48.313","cvssV3":8.2,"description":"apollo-client-nextjs is the Apollo Client support for the Next.js App Router. The @apollo/experimental-apollo-client-nextjs NPM package is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to either inject malicious input (e.g. by redirecting a user to a specifically-crafted link) or arrange to have malicious input be returned by a GraphQL server (e.g. by persisting it in a database). To fix this issue, please update to version 0.7.0 or later.","references":["https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/commit/b92bc42abd5f8e17d4db361c36bd08e4f541a46b","https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/security/advisories/GHSA-rv8p-rr2h-fgpg","https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/commit/b92bc42abd5f8e17d4db361c36bd08e4f541a46b","https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs/security/advisories/GHSA-rv8p-rr2h-fgpg"]}
