{"id":"CVE-2024-12066","publishedDate":"2024-12-21T07:15:08.907","cvssV3":8.8,"description":"The SMSA Shipping(official) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the smsa_delete_label() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/smsa-shipping-official/trunk/smsa-express-shipping.php#L235","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/29d72347-ba49-45c6-a964-2c75064ac866?source=cve"]}
