This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, update theme options, export widget options, import widget options, generate backups, restore backups, and reset theme options via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.","references":["https://themeforest.net/item/food-bakery-restaurant-bakery-responsive-wordpress-theme/18970331","https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/45eda79d-f999-413e-88ce-b7d06f09f191?source=cve"]}
