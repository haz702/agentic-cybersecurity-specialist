{"id":"CVE-2024-6331","publishedDate":"2024-08-04T00:15:47.863","cvssV3":7.5,"description":"stitionai/devika main branch as of commit cdfb782b0e634b773b10963c8034dc9207ba1f9f is vulnerable to Local File Read (LFI) by Prompt Injection. The integration of Google Gimini 1.0 Pro with `HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE` for `HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH` and `HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT` in `safety_settings` disables content protection. This allows malicious commands to be executed, such as reading sensitive file contents like `/etc/passwd`.","references":["https://huntr.com/bounties/d5ac1051-22fa-42f0-8d82-73267482e60f"]}
