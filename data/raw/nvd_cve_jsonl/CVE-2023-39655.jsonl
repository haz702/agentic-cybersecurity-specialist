{"id":"CVE-2023-39655","publishedDate":"2024-01-03T13:15:08.467","cvssV3":9.6,"description":"A host header injection vulnerability exists in the NPM package @perfood/couch-auth versions <= 0.20.0. By sending a specially crafted host header in the forgot password request, it is possible to send password reset links to users which, once clicked, lead to an attacker-controlled server and thus leak the password reset token. This may allow an attacker to reset other users' passwords and take over their accounts.","references":["https://github.com/dub-flow/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2023-39655","https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40perfood/couch-auth","https://github.com/dub-flow/vulnerability-research/tree/main/CVE-2023-39655","https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40perfood/couch-auth"]}
