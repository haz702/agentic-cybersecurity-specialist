{"id":"CVE-2024-41928","publishedDate":"2024-09-05T04:15:06.947","cvssV3":8.4,"description":"Malicious software running in a guest VM can exploit the buffer overflow to achieve code execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process, which typically runs as root. Note that bhyve runs in a Capsicum sandbox, so malicious code is constrained by the capabilities available to the bhyve process.","references":["https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-24:10.bhyve.asc","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240920-0009/"]}
