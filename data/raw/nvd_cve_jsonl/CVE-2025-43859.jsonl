{"id":"CVE-2025-43859","publishedDate":"2025-04-24T19:15:47.060","cvssV3":9.1,"description":"h11 is a Python implementation of HTTP/1.1. Prior to version 0.16.0, a leniency in h11's parsing of line terminators in chunked-coding message bodies can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. This issue has been patched in version 0.16.0. Since exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.","references":["https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/commit/114803a29ce50116dc47951c690ad4892b1a36ed","https://github.com/python-hyper/h11/security/advisories/GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj"]}
